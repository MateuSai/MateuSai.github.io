### 1

Τοιαῦτα μὲν δὴ ἀφίκοντο διαλεγόμενοι μέχρι τῶν ὁρίων τῆς Περσίδος· ἐπεὶ δ᾽ αὐτοῖς ἀετὸς δεξιὸς φανεὶς προηγεῖτο, προσευξάμενοι θεοῖς καὶ ἥρωσι τοῖς Περσίδα γῆν κατέχουσιν ἵλεως καὶ εὐμενεῖς πέμπειν σφᾶς, οὕτω διέβαινον τὰ ὅρια. ἐπειδὴ δὲ διέβησαν, προσηύχοντο αὖθις θεοῖς τοῖς Μηδίαν γῆν κατέχουσιν ἵλεως καὶ εὐμενεῖς δέχεσθαι αὐτούς. ταῦτα δὲ ποιήσαντες, ἀσπασάμενοι ἀλλήλους ὥσπερ εἰκός, ὁ μὲν πατὴρ πάλιν εἰς Πέρσας ἀπήιει, Κῦρος δὲ εἰς Μήδους πρὸς Κυαξάρην ἐπορεύετο.

Thus they talked together, and thus they journeyed on until they reached the frontier, and there a good omen met them: an eagle swept into view on the right, and went before them as though to lead the way, and they prayed the gods and heroes of the land to show them favour and grant them safe entry, and then they crossed the boundary. And when they were across, they prayed once more that the gods of Media might receive them graciously, and when they had done this they embraced each other, as father and son will, and Cambyses turned back to his own city, but Cyrus went forward again, to his uncle Cyaxares in the land of Media.

ἐπεὶ δὲ ἀφίκετο ὁ Κῦρος εἰς Μήδους πρὸς τὸν Κυαξάρην, πρῶτον μὲν ὥσπερ εἰκὸς ἠσπάσαντο ἀλλήλους, ἔπειτα δὲ ἤρετο τὸν Κῦρον ὁ Κυαξάρης πόσον τι ἄγοι τὸ στράτευμα. ὁ δὲ ἔφη· Τρισμυρίους μέν γε οἷοι καὶ πρόσθεν ἐφοίτων πρὸς ὑμᾶς μισθοφόροι· ἄλλοι δὲ καὶ τῶν οὐδεπώποτε ἐξελθόντων προσέρχονται τῶν ὁμοτίμων. Πόσοι τινές; ἔφη ὁ Κυαξάρης.

And when his journey was done and he was face to face with him and they had greeted each other as kinsmen may, then Cyaxares asked the prince how great an armament he had brought with him? And Cyrus answered, "I have 30,000 with me, men who have served with you before as mercenaries; and more are coming on behind, fresh troops, from the Peers of Persia." "How many of those?" asked Cyaxares.

Οὐκ ἂν ὁ ἀριθμός σε, ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος, ἀκούσαντα εὐφράνειεν· ἀλλ᾽ ἐκεῖνο ἐννόησον ὅτι ὀλίγοι ὄντες οὗτοι οἱ ὁμότιμοι καλούμενοι πολλῶν ὄντων τῶν ἄλλων Περσῶν ῥαιδίως ἄρχουσιν. ἀτάρ, ἔφη, δέει τι αὐτῶν ἢ μάτην ἐφοβήθης, οἱ δὲ πολέμιοι οὐκ ἔρχονται; Ναὶ μὰ Δί᾽, ἔφη, καὶ πολλοί γε.

And Cyrus answered, "Their numbers will not please you, but remember these Peers of ours, though they are few, find it easy to rule the rest of the Persians, who are many. But now," he added, "have you any need of us at all? Perhaps it was only a false alarm that troubled you, and the enemy are not advancing?" "Indeed they are," said the other, "and in full force." 

Πῶς τοῦτο σαφές; Ὅτι, ἔφη, πολλοὶ ἥκοντες αὐτόθεν ἄλλος ἄλλον τρόπον πάντες ταὐτὸ λέγουσιν. Ἀγωνιστέον μὲν ἄρα ἡμῖν πρὸς τοὺς ἄνδρας. Ἀνάγκη γάρ, ἔφη. Τί οὖν, ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος, οὐ καὶ τὴν δύναμιν ἔλεξάς μοι, εἰ οἶσθε, πόση τις ἡ προσιοῦσα, καὶ πάλιν τὴν ἡμετέραν, ὅπως εἰδότες ἀμφοτέρας πρὸς ταῦτα βουλευώμεθα ὅπως ἂν ἄριστα ἀγωνιζοίμεθα; Ἄκουε δή, ἔφη ὁ Κυαξάρης.

"How do you know?" asked Cyrus. "Because," said he, "many deserters come to us, and all of them, in one fashion or another, tell the same tale." "Then we must give battle?" said Cyrus. "Needs must," Cyaxares replied. "Well," answered Cyrus, "but you have not told me yet how great their power is, or our own either. I want to hear, if you can tell me, so that we may make our plans." "Listen, then," said Cyaxares.

Κροῖσος μὲν ὁ Λυδὸς ἄγειν λέγεται μυρίους μὲν ἱππέας, πελταστὰς δὲ καὶ τοξότας πλείους ἢ τετρακισμυρίους. Ἀρτακάμαν δὲ τὸν τῆς μεγάλης Φρυγίας ἄρχοντα λέγουσιν ἱππέας μὲν εἰς ὀκτακισχιλίους ἄγειν, λογχοφόρους δὲ σὺν πελτασταῖς οὐ μείους τετρακισμυρίων, Ἀρίβαιον δὲ τὸν τῶν Καππαδοκῶν βασιλέα ἱππέας μὲν ἑξακισχιλίους, τοξότας δὲ καὶ πελταστὰς οὐ μείους τρισμυρίων, τὸν Ἀράβιον δὲ Ἄραγδον ἱππέας τε εἰς μυρίους καὶ ἅρματα εἰς ἑκατὸν καὶ σφενδονητῶν πάμπολύ τι χρῆμα. τοὺς μέντοι Ἕλληνας τοὺς ἐν τῆι Ἀσίαι οἰκοῦντας οὐδέν πω σαφὲς λέγεται εἰ ἕπονται. τοὺς δὲ ἀπὸ Φρυγίας τῆς πρὸς Ἑλλησπόντωι συμβαλεῖν φασι Γάβαιδον ἔχοντα εἰς Καΰστρου πεδίον ἑξακισχιλίους μὲν ἱππέας, πελταστὰς δὲ εἰς μυρίους. Κᾶρας μέντοι καὶ Κίλικας καὶ Παφλαγόνας παρακληθέντας οὔ φασιν ἕπεσθαι. ὁ δὲ Ἀσσύριος ὁ Βαβυλῶνά τε ἔχων καὶ τὴν ἄλλην Ἀσσυρίαν ἐγὼ μὲν οἶμαι ἱππέας μὲν ἄξει οὐκ ἐλάττους δισμυρίων, ἅρματα δ᾽ εὖ οἶδ᾽ οὐ μεῖον διακοσίων, πεζοὺς δὲ οἶμαι παμπόλλους· εἰώθει γοῦν ὁπότε δεῦρ᾽ ἐμβάλλοι.

"Croesus the Lydian is coming, we hear, with 10,000 horse and more than 40,000 archers and targeteers. Artamas the governor of Greater Phrygia is bringing, they say, 8000 horse, and lancers and targeteers also, 40,000 strong. Then there is Aribaius the king of Cappadocia with 6000 horse and 30,000 archers and targeteers. And Aragdus the Arabian with 10,000 horse, a hundred chariots, and innumerable slingers. As for the Hellenes who dwell in Asia, it is not clear as yet whether they will send a following or not. But the Phrygians from the Hellespont, we are told, are mustering in the Caystrian plain under Gabaidus, 6000 horse and 40,000 targeteers. Word has been sent to the Carians, Cilicians, and Paphlagonians, but it is said they will not rise; the Lord of Assyria and Babylon will himself, I believe, bring not less than 20,000 horse, and I make no doubt as many as 200 chariots, and thousands upon thousands of men on foot; such at least has been his custom whenever he invaded us before."

Σύ, ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος, πολεμίους λέγεις ἱππέας μὲν ἑξακισμυρίους εἶναι, πελταστὰς δὲ καὶ τοξότας πλέον ἢ εἴκοσι μυριάδας. ἄγε δὴ τῆς σῆς δυνάμεως τί φὴις πλῆθος εἶναι; Εἰσίν, ἔφη, Μήδων μὲν ἱππεῖς πλείους τῶν μυρίων· πελτασταὶ δὲ καὶ τοξόται γένοιντ᾽ ἄν πως ἐκ τῆς ἡμετέρας κἂν ἑξακισμύριοι. Ἀρμενίων δ᾽, ἔφη, τῶν ὁμόρων ἡμῖν παρέσονται ἱππεῖς μὲν τετρακισχίλιοι, πεζοὶ δὲ δισμύριοι. Λέγεις σύ, ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος, ἱππέας μὲν ἡμῖν εἶναι μεῖον ἢ τέταρτον μέρος τοῦ τῶν πολεμίων ἱππικοῦ, πεζοὺς δὲ ἀμφὶ τοὺς ἡμίσεις.

Cyrus answered: "Then you reckon the numbers of the enemy to be, in all, something like 60,000 horse and 200,000 archers and targeteers. And what do you take your own to be?" "Well," he answered, "we ourselves can furnish over 10,000 horse and perhaps, considering the state of the country, as many as 60,000 archers and targeteers. And from our neighbours, the Armenians," he added, "we look to get 4000 horse and 20,000 foot." "I see," said Cyrus, "you reckon our cavalry at less than a third of the enemy's, and our infantry at less than half." 

Τί οὖν, ἔφη ὁ Κυαξάρης, οὐκ ὀλίγους νομίζεις Περσῶν εἶναι οὓς σὺ φὴις ἄγειν; Ἀλλ᾽ εἰ μὲν ἀνδρῶν προσδεῖ ἡμῖν, ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος, εἴτε καὶ μή, αὖθις συμβουλευσόμεθα· τὴν δὲ μάχην μοι, ἔφη, λέξον ἑκάστων ἥτις ἐστί. Σχεδόν, ἔφη ὁ Κυαξάρης, πάντων ἡ αὐτή· τοξόται γάρ εἰσι καὶ ἀκοντισταὶ οἵ τ᾽ ἐκείνων καὶ οἱ ἡμέτεροι. Οὐκοῦν, ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος, ἀκροβολίζεσθαι ἀνάγκη ἐστὶ τοιούτων γε τῶν ὅπλων ὄντων.

"Ah," said Cyaxares, "and perhaps you feel that the force you are bringing from Persia is very small?" "We will consider that later on," answered Cyrus, "and see then if we require more men or not. Tell me first the methods of fighting that the different troops adopt." "They are much the same for all," answered Cyaxares, "that is to say, their men and ours alike are armed with bows and javelins." "Well," replied Cyrus, "if such arms are used, skirmishing at long range must be the order of the day."

"True," said the other.

Ἀνάγκη γὰρ οὖν, ἔφη ὁ Κυαξάρης·

οὐκοῦν ἐν τούτωι μὲν τῶν πλειόνων ἡ νίκη· πολὺ γὰρ ἂν θᾶττον οἱ ὀλίγοι ὑπὸ τῶν πολλῶν τιτρωσκόμενοι ἀναλωθείησαν ἢ οἱ πολλοὶ ὑπὸ τῶν ὀλίγων· εἰ οὖν οὕτως ἔχει, ὦ Κῦρε, τί ἂν ἄλλο τις κρεῖττον εὕροι ἢ πέμπειν ἐς Πέρσας, καὶ ἅμα μὲν διδάσκειν αὐτοὺς ὅτι εἴ τι πείσονται Μῆδοι, εἰς Πέρσας τὸ δεινὸν ἥξει, ἅμα δὲ αἰτεῖν πλέον στράτευμα; Ἀλλὰ τοῦτο μέν, ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος, εὖ ἴσθι ὅτι, οὐδ᾽ εἰ πάντες ἔλθοιεν Πέρσαι, πλήθει γε οὐχ ὑπερβαλοίμεθ᾽ ἂν τοὺς πολεμίους.

"And in that case," went on Cyrus, "the victory is in the hands of the larger force; for even if the same numbers fall on either side, the few would be exhausted long before the many." "If that be so," cried Cyaxares, "there is nothing left for us but to send to Persia, and make them see that if disaster falls on Media it will fall on Persia next, and beg them for a larger force." "Ah, but," said Cyrus, "you must remember that even if every single Persian were to come at once, we could not outnumber our enemies."

Τί μὴν ἄλλο ἐνορᾶις ἄμεινον τούτου; Ἐγὼ μὲν ἄν, ἔφη ὁ Κῦρος, εἰ σὺ εἴην, ὡς τάχιστα ὅπλα ποιοίμην πᾶσι Πέρσαις τοῖς προσιοῦσιν οἷάπερ ἔχοντες ἔρχονται παρ᾽ ἡμῶν οἱ τῶν ὁμοτίμων καλούμενοι· ταῦτα δ᾽ ἐστὶ θώραξ μὲν περὶ τὰ στέρνα, γέρρον δὲ εἰς τὴν ἀριστεράν, κοπὶς δὲ ἢ σάγαρις εἰς τὴν δεξιάν· κἂν ταῦτα παρασκευάσηις, ἡμῖν μὲν ποιήσεις τὸ ὁμόσε τοῖς ἐναντίοις ἰέναι ἀσφαλέστατον, τοῖς πολεμίοις δὲ τὸ φεύγειν ἢ τὸ μένειν αἱρετώτερον. τάττομεν δέ, ἔφη, ἡμᾶς μὲν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τοὺς μένοντας· οἵ γε μέντἂν αὐτῶν φεύγωσι, τούτους ὑμῖν καὶ τοῖς ἵπποις νέμομεν, ὡς μὴ σχολάζωσι μήτε μένειν μήτε ἀναστρέφεσθαι.

"But," said the other, "can you see anything else to be done?" "For my part," answered Cyrus, "if I could have my way, I would arm every Persian who is coming here in precisely the same fashion as our Peers at home, that is to say, with a corslet for the breast, a shield for the left arm, and a sword or battle-axe for the right hand. If you will give us these you will make it quite safe for us to close with the enemy, and our foes will find that flight is far pleasanter than defence. But we Persians," he added, "will deal with those who do stand firm, leaving the fugitives to you and to your cavalry, who must give them no time to rally and no time to escape."

Κῦρος μὲν οὕτως ἔλεξε· τῶι δὲ Κυαξάρηι ἔδοξέ τε εὖ λέγειν, καὶ τοῦ μὲν πλείους μεταπέμπεσθαι οὐκέτι ἐμέμνητο, παρεσκευάζετο δὲ ὅπλα τὰ προειρημένα. καὶ σχεδόν τε ἕτοιμα ἦν καὶ τῶν Περσῶν οἱ ὁμότιμοι παρῆσαν ἔχοντες τὸ ἀπὸ Περσῶν στράτευμα.

That was the counsel of Cyrus, and Cyaxares approved it. He thought no more of sending for a larger force, but set about preparing the equipment he had been asked for, and all was in readiness just about the time when the Peers arrived from Persia at the head of their own troops.

ἐνταῦθα δὴ εἰπεῖν λέγεται ὁ Κῦρος συναγαγὼν αὐτούς· Ἄνδρες φίλοι, ἐγὼ ὑμᾶς ὁρῶν αὐτοὺς μὲν καθωπλισμένους οὕτω καὶ ταῖς ψυχαῖς παρεσκευασμένους ὡς εἰς χεῖρας συμμείξοντας τοῖς πολεμίοις, τοὺς δὲ ἑπομένους ὑμῖν Πέρσας γιγνώσκων ὅτι οὕτως ὡπλισμένοι εἰσὶν ὡς ὅτι προσωτάτω ταχθέντες μάχεσθαι, ἔδεισα μὴ ὀλίγοι καὶ ἔρημοι συμμάχων συμπίπτοντες πολεμίοις πολλοῖς πάθοιτέ τι. νῦν οὖν, ἔφη, σώματα μὲν ἔχοντες ἀνδρῶν ἥκετε οὐ μεμπτά· ὅπλα δὲ ἔσται αὐτοῖς ὅμοια τοῖς ἡμετέροις· τάς γε μέντοι ψυχὰς θήγειν αὐτῶν ὑμέτερον ἔργον. ἄρχοντος γάρ ἐστιν οὐχ ἑαυτὸν μόνον ἀγαθὸν παρέχειν, ἀλλὰ δεῖ καὶ τῶν ἀρχομένων ἐπιμελεῖσθαι ὅπως ὡς βέλτιστοι ἔσονται.

Then, so says the story, Cyrus called the Peers together and spoke to them as follows: "Men of Persia, my friends and comrades, when I looked at you first and saw the arms you bore and how you were all on fire to meet the enemy, hand to hand, and when I remembered that your squires are only equipped for fighting on the outskirts of the field, I confess my mind misgave me. Few and forlorn they will be, I said to myself, swallowed up in a host of enemies; no good can come of it. But to-day you are here, and your men behind you, stalwart and stout of limb, and to-morrow they shall have armour like our own. None could find fault with their thews and sinews, and as for their spirit, it is for us to see it does not fail. A leader must not only have a stout heart himself; he must see to it that his followers are as valiant as he."

Ὁ μὲν οὕτως εἶπεν· οἱ δ᾽ ἥσθησαν μὲν πάντες, νομίζοντες μετὰ πλειόνων ἀγωνιεῖσθαι· εἷς δ᾽ αὐτῶν καὶ ἔλεξε τοιάδε.

Thus Cyrus spoke, and the Peers were well satisfied at his words, feeling that on the day of battle they would have more to help them in the struggle.

Ἀλλὰ θαυμαστά, ἔφη, ἴσως δόξω λέγειν, εἰ Κύρωι συμβουλεύσω τι εἰπεῖν ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν, ὅταν τὰ ὅπλα λαμβάνωσιν οἱ ἡμῖν μέλλοντες συμμάχεσθαι· ἀλλὰ γιγνώσκω γάρ, ἔφη, ὅτι οἱ τῶν ἱκανωτάτων καὶ εὖ καὶ κακῶς ποιεῖν λόγοι οὗτοι καὶ μάλιστα ἐνδύονται ταῖς ψυχαῖς τῶν ἀκουόντων· καὶ δῶρά γε ἢν διδῶσιν οἱ τοιοῦτοι, κἂν μείω τυγχάνηι ὄντα ἢ τὰ παρὰ τῶν ὁμοίων, ὅμως μείζονος αὐτὰ τιμῶνται οἱ λαμβάνοντες. καὶ νῦν, ἔφη, οἱ Πέρσαι παραστάται ὑπὸ Κύρου πολὺ μᾶλλον ἡσθήσονται ἢ ὑφ᾽ ἡμῶν παρακαλούμενοι, εἴς τε τοὺς ὁμοτίμους καθιστάμενοι βεβαιοτέρως σφίσιν ἡγήσονται ἔχειν τοῦτο ὑπὸ βασιλέως τε παιδὸς καὶ ὑπὸ στρατηγοῦ γενόμενον ἢ εἰ ὑφ᾽ ἡμῶν τὸ αὐτὸ τοῦτο γίγνοιτο. ἀπεῖναι μέντοι οὐδὲ τὰ ἡμέτερα χρή, ἀλλὰ παντὶ τρόπωι δεῖ τῶν ἀνδρῶν θήγειν πάντως τὸ φρόνημα. ἡμῖν γὰρ ἔσται τοῦτο χρήσιμον ὅ τι ἂν οὗτοι βελτίονες γένωνται.

And one of them said, "Perhaps it will seem strange if I ask Cyrus to speak in our stead to our fellow-combatants when they receive their arms, and yet I know well that the words of him who has the greatest power for weal or woe sink deepest into the listener's heart. His very gifts, though they should be less than the gifts of equals, are valued more. These new comrades of ours," he went on, "would rather be addressed by Cyrus himself than by us, and now that they are to take their place among the Peers their title will seem to them far more secure if it is given them by the king's own son and our general-in-chief. Not that we have not still our own duties left. We are bound to do our best in every way to rouse the spirit of our men. Shall we not gain ourselves by all they gain in valour?"

Οὕτω δὴ ὁ Κῦρος καταθεὶς τὰ ὅπλα εἰς τὸ μέσον καὶ συγκαλέσας πάντας τοὺς Περσῶν στρατιώτας ἔλεξε τοιάδε.

So it came about that Cyrus had the new armour placed before him and summoned a general meeting of the Persian soldiery, and spoke to them as follows:

Ἄνδρες Πέρσαι, ὑμεῖς καὶ ἔφυτε ἐν τῆι αὐτῆι ἡμῖν καὶ ἐτράφητε, καὶ τὰ σώματά τε οὐδὲν ἡμῶν χείρονα ἔχετε, ψυχάς τε οὐδὲν κακίονας ὑμῖν προσήκει ἡμῶν ἔχειν. τοιοῦτοι δ᾽ ὄντες ἐν μὲν τῆι πατρίδι οὐ μετείχετε τῶν ἴσων ἡμῖν, οὐχ ὑφ᾽ ἡμῶν ἀπελαθέντες ἀλλ᾽ ὑπὸ τοῦ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἀνάγκην ὑμῖν εἶναι πορίζεσθαι. νῦν δὲ ὅπως μὲν ταῦτα ἕξετε ἐμοὶ μελήσει σὺν τοῖς θεοῖς· ἔξεστι δ᾽ ὑμῖν, εἰ βούλεσθε, λαβόντας ὅπλα οἷάπερ ἡμεῖς ἔχομεν εἰς τὸν αὐτὸν ἡμῖν κίνδυνον ἐμβαίνειν, καὶ ἄν τι ἐκ τούτων καλὸν κἀγαθὸν γίγνηται, τῶν ὁμοίων ἡμῖν ἀξιοῦσθαι.

"Men of Persia, born and bred in the same land as ourselves, whose limbs are as stout and as strong as our own, your hearts should be as brave. I know they are; and yet at home in the land of our fathers you did not share our rights; not that we drove you out ourselves, but you were banished by the compulsion that lay upon you to find your livelihood for yourselves. Now from this day forward, with heaven's help, it shall be my care to provide it for you; and now, if so you will, you have it in your power to take the armour that we wear ourselves, face the same perils and win the same honours, if so be you make any glorious deed your own.

τὸν μὲν οὖν πρόσθεν χρόνον ὑμεῖς τε τοξόται καὶ ἀκοντισταὶ ἦτε καὶ ἡμεῖς, καὶ εἴ τι χείρους ἡμῶν ταῦτα ποιεῖν ἦτε, οὐδὲν θαυμαστόν· οὐ γὰρ ἦν ὑμῖν σχολὴ ὥσπερ ἡμῖν τούτων ἐπιμελεῖσθαι· ἐν δὲ ταύτηι τῆι ὁπλίσει οὐδὲν ἡμεῖς ὑμῶν προέξομεν. θώραξ μέν γε περὶ τὰ στέρνα ἁρμόττων ἑκάστωι ἔσται, γέρρον δὲ ἐν τῆι ἀριστερᾶι, ὃ πάντες εἰθίσμεθα φορεῖν, μάχαιρα δὲ ἢ σάγαρις ἐν τῆι δεξιᾶι, ἧι δὴ παίειν τοὺς ἐναντίους δεήσει οὐδὲν φυλαττομένους μή τι παίοντες ἐξαμάρτωμεν.

In former days you were trained, like ourselves, in the use of bow and javelin, and if you were at all inferior to us in skill, that was not to be wondered at; you had not the same leisure for practice as we; but now in this new accoutrement we shall have no pre-eminence at all. Each of us will wear a corslet fitted to his breast and carry a shield on his left arm of the type to which we are all accustomed, and in his right hand a sabre or a battle-axe. With these we shall smite the enemy before us, and need have no fear that we shall miss the mark.

τί οὖν ἂν ἐν τούτοις ἕτερος ἑτέρου διαφέροι ἡμῶν πλὴν τόλμηι; ἣν οὐδὲν ὑμῖν ἧττον προσήκει ἢ ἡμῖν ὑποτρέφεσθαι. νίκης τε γὰρ ἐπιθυμεῖν, ἣ τὰ καλὰ πάντα καὶ τ᾽αγαθὰ κτᾶταί τε καὶ σώιζει, τί μᾶλλον ἡμῖν ἢ ὑμῖν προσήκει; κράτους τε, ὃ πάντα τὰ τῶν ἡττόνων τοῖς κρείττοσι δωρεῖται, τί εἰκὸς ἡμᾶς μᾶλλον ἢ καὶ ὑμᾶς τούτου δεῖσθαι;

How can we differ from one another with these arms? There can be no difference except in daring. And daring you may foster in your hearts as much as we in ours. What greater right have we than you to love victory and follow after her, victory who wins for us and preserves to us all things that are beautiful and good? Why should you, any more than we, be found lacking in that power which takes the goods of weaklings and bestows them on the strong?"

τέλος εἶπεν· Ἀκηκόατε πάντα· ὁρᾶτε τὰ ὅπλα· ὁ μὲν χρήιζων λαμβανέτω ταῦτα καὶ ἀπογραφέσθω πρὸς τὸν ταξίαρχον εἰς τὴν ὁμοίαν τάξιν ἡμῖν· ὅτωι δ᾽ ἀρκεῖ ἐν μισθοφόρου χώραι εἶναι, καταμενέτω ἐν τοῖς ὑπηρετικοῖς ὅπλοις. ὁ μὲν οὕτως εἶπεν.

He ended: "Now you have heard all. There lie your weapons; let him who chooses take them up and write his name with the brigadier in the same roll as ours. And if a man prefers to remain a mercenary, let him do so; he carries the arms of a servant."

ἀκούσαντες δὲ οἱ Πέρσαι ἐνόμισαν, εἰ παρακαλούμενοι ὥστε τὰ ὅμοια πονοῦντες τῶν αὐτῶν τυγχάνειν μὴ ἐθελήσουσι ταῦτα ποιεῖν, δικαίως ἂν διὰ παντὸς τοῦ αἰῶνος ἀμηχανοῦντες βιοτεύειν. οὕτω δὴ ἀπογράφονται πάντες ἀνέλαβόν τε τὰ ὅπλα πάντες.

Thus spoke Cyrus; and the Persians, every man of them, felt they would be ashamed for the rest of their days, and deservedly, if they drew back now, when they were offered equal honour in return for equal toil. One and all they inscribed their names and took up the new arms.

Ἐν ὧι δὲ οἱ πολέμιοι ἐλέγοντο μὲν προσιέναι, παρῆσαν δὲ οὐδέπω, ἐν τούτωι ἐπειρᾶτο ὁ Κῦρος ἀσκεῖν μὲν τὰ σώματα τῶν μεθ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ εἰς ἰσχύν, διδάσκειν δὲ τὰ τακτικά, θήγειν δὲ τὰς ψυχὰς εἰς τὰ πολεμικά.

And now in the interval, before the enemy were actually at hand, but while rumour said they were advancing, Cyrus took on himself a three-fold task: to bring the physical strength of his men to the highest pitch, to teach them tactics, and to rouse their spirit for martial deeds.

καὶ πρῶτον μὲν λαβὼν παρὰ Κυαξάρου ὑπηρέτας προσέταξεν ἑκάστοις τῶν στρατιωτῶν ἱκανῶς ὧν ἐδέοντο πάντα πεποιημένα παρασχεῖν· τοῦτο δὲ παρασκευάσας οὐδὲν αὐτοῖς ἐλελοίπει ἄλλο ἢ ἀσκεῖν τὰ ἀμφὶ τὸν πόλεμον, ἐκεῖνο δοκῶν καταμεμαθηκέναι ὅτι οὗτοι κράτιστοι ἕκαστα γίγνονται οἳ ἂν ἀφέμενοι τοῦ πολλοῖς προσέχειν τὸν νοῦν ἐπὶ ἓν ἔργον τράπωνται. καὶ αὐτῶν δὲ τῶν πολεμικῶν περιελὼν καὶ τὸ τόξωι μελετᾶν καὶ ἀκοντίωι κατέλιπε τοῦτο μόνον αὐτοῖς τὸ σὺν μαχαίραι καὶ γέρρωι καὶ θώρακι μάχεσθαι· ὥστε εὐθὺς αὐτῶν παρεσκεύασε τὰς γνώμας ὡς ὁμόσε ἰτέον εἴη τοῖς πολεμίοις, ἢ ὁμολογητέον μηδενὸς εἶναι ἀξίους συμμάχους· τοῦτο δὲ χαλεπὸν ὁμολογῆσαι οἵτινες ἂν εἰδῶσιν ὅτι οὐδὲ δι᾽ ἓν ἄλλο τρέφονται ἢ ὅπως μαχοῦνται ὑπὲρ τῶν τρεφόντων.

He asked Cyaxares for a body of assistants whose duty it should be to provide each of his soldiers with all they could possibly need, thus leaving the men themselves free for the art of war. He had learnt, he thought, that success, in whatever sphere, was only to be won by refusing to attempt a multitude of tasks and concentrating the mind on one. Thus in the military training itself he gave up the practice with bow and javelin, leaving his men to perfect themselves in the use of sabre, shield, and corslet, accustoming them from the very first to the thought that they must close with the enemy, or confess themselves worthless as fellow-combatants; a harsh conclusion for those who knew that they were only protected in order to fight on behalf of their protectors.

ἔτι δὲ πρὸς τούτοις ἐννοήσας ὅτι περὶ ὁπόσων ἂν ἐγγένωνται ἀνθρώποις φιλονικίαι, πολὺ μᾶλλον ἐθέλουσι ταῦτ᾽ ἀσκεῖν, ἀγῶνάς τε αὐτοῖς προεῖπεν ἁπάντων ὁπόσα ἐγίγνωσκεν ἀσκεῖσθαι ἀγαθὸν εἶναι ὑπὸ στρατιωτῶν καὶ προεῖπε τάδε, ἰδιώτηι μὲν ἑαυτὸν παρέχειν εὐπειθῆ τοῖς ἄρχουσι καὶ ἐθελόπονον καὶ φιλοκίνδυνον μετ᾽ εὐταξίας καὶ ἐπιστήμονα τῶν στρατιωτικῶν καὶ φιλόκαλον περὶ ὅπλα καὶ φιλότιμον ἐπὶ πᾶσι τοῖς τοιούτοις, πεμπαδάρχωι δ᾽ αὐτὸν ὄντα οἷόνπερ τὸν ἀγαθὸν ἰδιώτην καὶ τὴν πεμπάδα εἰς τὸ δυνατὸν τοιαύτην παρέχειν, δεκαδάρχωι δὲ τὴν δεκάδα ὡσαύτως, λοχαγῶι δὲ τὸν λόχον, καὶ ταξιάρχωι ἀνεπίκλητον αὐτὸν ὄντα ἐπιμελεῖσθαι καὶ τῶν ὑφ᾽ αὑτῶι ἀρχόντων ὅπως ἐκεῖνοι αὖ ὧν ἂν ἄρχωσι παρέξουσι τὰ δέοντα ποιοῦντας.

And further, being convinced that wherever the feeling of emulation can be roused, there the eagerness to excel is greatest, he instituted competitions for everything in which he thought his soldiers should be trained. The private soldier was challenged to prove himself prompt to obey, anxious to work, eager for danger, and yet ever mindful of discipline, an expert in the science of war, an artist in the conduct of his arms, and a lover of honour in all things. The petty officer commanding a squad of five was not only to equal the leading private, he must also do what he could to bring his men to the same perfection; the captain of ten must do the same for his ten, and the company's captain for the company, while the commander of the whole regiment, himself above reproach, must take the utmost care with the officers under him so that they in their turn should see that their subordinates were perfect in all their duties.

ἆθλα δὲ προύφηνε τοῖς μὲν ταξιάρχοις ὡς τοὺς κρατίστας δόξαντας τὰς τάξεις παρεσκευάσθαι χιλιάρχους ἔσεσθαι, τῶν δὲ λοχαγῶν οἳ κρατίστους δόξειαν τοὺς λόχους ἀποδεικνύναι, εἰς τὰς τῶν ταξιάρχων χώρας ἐπαναβήσεσθαι, τῶν δ᾽ αὖ δεκαδάρχων τοὺς κρατίστους εἰς τὰς τῶν λοχαγῶν χώρας καταστήσεσθαι, τῶν δ᾽ αὖ πεμπαδάρχων ὡσαύτως εἰς τὰς τῶν δεκαδάρχων, τῶν γε μὴν ἰδιωτῶν τοὺς κρατιστεύοντας εἰς τὰς τῶν πεμπαδάρχων. ὑπῆρχε δὲ πᾶσι τούτοις τοῖς ἄρχουσι πρῶτον μὲν θεραπεύεσθαι ὑπὸ τῶν ἀρχομένων, ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ ἄλλαι τιμαὶ αἱ πρέπουσαι ἑκάστοις συμπαρείποντο. ἐπανετείνοντο δὲ καὶ μείζονες ἐλπίδες τοῖς ἀξίοις ἐπαίνου, εἴ τι ἐν τῶι ἐπιόντι χρόνωι ἀγαθὸν μεῖζον φανοῖτο·

For prizes, Cyrus announced that the brigadier in command of the finest regiment should be raised to the rank of general, the captain of the finest company should be made a brigadier, the captain of the finest squad of ten captain of a company, and the captain of the best five a captain of ten, while the best soldiers from the ranks should become captains of five themselves. Every one of these officers had the privilege of being served by those beneath him, and various other honours also, suited to their several grades, while ampler hopes were offered for any nobler exploits.

προεῖπε δὲ νικητήρια καὶ ὅλαις ταῖς τάξεσι καὶ ὅλοις τοῖς λόχοις, καὶ ταῖς δεκάσιν ὡσαύτως καὶ ταῖς πεμπάσιν, αἳ ἂν φαίνωνται εὐπιστόταται τοῖς ἄρχουσιν οὖσαι καὶ προθυμότατα ἀσκοῦσαι τὰ προειρημένα. ἦν δὲ ταύταις τὰ νικητήρια οἷα δὴ εἰς πλῆθος πρέπει. ταῦτα μὲν δὴ προείρητό τε καὶ ἠσκεῖτο ἡ στρατιά.

Finally prizes were announced to be won by a regiment or a company or a squad taken as a whole, by those who proved themselves most loyal to their leaders and most zealous in the practice of their duty. These prizes, of course, were such as to be suitable for men taken in the mass. Such were the orders of the Persian leader, and such the exercises of the Persian troops.

σκηνὰς δ᾽ αὐτοῖς κατεσκεύασε, πλῆθος μὲν ὅσοι ταξίαρχοι ἦσαν, μέγεθος δὲ ὥστε ἱκανὰς εἶναι τῆι τάξει ἑκάστηι· ἡ δὲ τάξις ἦν ἑκατὸν ἄνδρες. ἐσκήνουν μὲν δὴ οὕτω κατὰ τάξεις· ἐν δὲ τῶι ὁμοῦ σκηνοῦν ἐδόκουν μὲν αὐτῶι ὠφελεῖσθαι πρὸς τὸν μέλλοντα ἀγῶνα τοῦτο ὅτι ἑώρων ἀλλήλους ὁμοίως τρεφομένους καὶ οὐκ ἐνῆν πρόφασις μειονεξίας ὥστε ὑφίεσθαί τινας κακίω ἕτερον ἑτέρου εἶναι πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους. ὠφελεῖσθαι δ᾽ ἐδόκουν αὐτῶι καὶ πρὸς τὸ γιγνώσκειν ἀλλήλους ὁμοῦ σκηνοῦντες. ἐν δὲ τῶι γιγνώσκεσθαι καὶ τὸ αἰσχύνεσθαι πᾶσι δοκεῖ μᾶλλον ἐγγίγνεσθαι, οἱ δ᾽ ἀγνοούμενοι ῥαιδιουργεῖν πως μᾶλλον δοκοῦσιν, ὥσπερ ἐν σκότει ὄντες.

For their quarters, he arranged that a separate shelter should be assigned to every brigadier, and that it should be large enough for the whole regiment he commanded; a regiment consisting of 100 men. Thus they were encamped by regiments, and in the mere fact of common quarters there was this advantage, Cyrus thought, for the coming struggle, that the men saw they were all treated alike, and therefore no one could pretend that he was slighted, and no one sink to the confession that he was a worse man than his neighbours when it came to facing the foe. Moreover the life in common would help the men to know each other, and it is only by such knowledge, as a rule, that a common conscience is engendered; those who live apart, unknowing and unknown, seem far more apt for mischief, like those who skulk in the dark.

ἐδόκουν δ᾽ αὐτῶι καὶ εἰς τὸ τὰς τάξεις ἀκριβοῦν μεγάλα ὠφελεῖσθαι διὰ τὴν συσκηνίαν. εἶχον γὰρ οἱ μὲν ταξίαρχοι ὑφ᾽ ἑαυτοῖς τὰς τάξεις κεκοσμημένας ὥσπερ ὁπότε εἰς ἕνα πορεύοιτο ἡ τάξις, οἱ δὲ λοχαγοὶ τοὺς λόχους ὡσαύτως, οἱ δὲ δεκάδαρχοι δεκάδας, πεμπάδαρχοι πεμπάδας.

Cyrus thought the common life would lead to the happiest results in the discipline of the regiments. By this system all the officers—brigadiers, company-captains, captains of the squads—could keep their men in as perfect order as if they were marching before them in single file.

τὸ δὲ διακριβοῦν τὰς τάξε1ς σφόδρα ἐδόκει αὐτῶι ἀγαθὸν εἶναι καὶ εἰς τὸ μὴ ταράττεσθαι καὶ εἰ ταραχθεῖεν θᾶττον καταστῆναι, ὥσπερ γε καὶ λίθων καὶ ξύλων ἂν δέηι συναρμοσθῆναι, ἔστι, κἂν ὁπωσοῦν καταβεβλημένα τύχηι, συναρμόσαι αὐτὰ εὐπετῶς, ἢν ἔχηι γνωρίσματα ὥστ᾽ εὔδηλον εἶναι ἐξ ὁποίας ἕκαστον χώρας αὐτῶν ἐστιν.

Such precision in the ranks would do most to guard against disorder and re-establish order if ever it were broken; just as when timbers and stones have to be fitted together it is easy enough to put them into place, wherever they chance to lie, provided only that they are marked so as to leave no doubt where each belongs.

ἐδόκουν δ᾽ ὠφελεῖσθαι αὐτῶι ὁμοῦ τρεφόμενοι καὶ πρὸς τὸ ἧττον ἀλλήλους θέλειν ἀπολιπεῖν, ὅτι ἑώρα καὶ τὰ θηρία τὰ συντρεφόμενα δεινὸν ἕχοντα πόθον, ἤν τις αὐτὰ διασπᾶι ἀπ᾽ ἀλλήλων.

And finally, he felt, there was the fact that those who live together are the less likely to desert one another; even the wild animals, Cyrus knew, who are reared together suffer terribly from loneliness when they are severed from each other.

ἐπεμέλετο δὲ καὶ τούτου ὁ Κῦρος ὅπως μήποτε ἀνίδρωτοι γενόμενοι ἐπὶ τὸ ἄριστον καὶ τὸ δεῖπνον εἰσίοιεν. ἢ γὰρ ἐπὶ θήραν ἐξάγων ἱδρῶτα αὐτοῖς παρεῖχεν, ἢ παιδιὰς τοιαύτας ἐξηύρισκεν αἳ ἱδρῶτα ἔμελλον παρέχειν, ἢ καὶ πρᾶξαι εἴ τι δεόμενος τύχοι, οὕτως ἐξηγεῖτο τῆς πράξεως ὡς μὲ ἐπανίοιεν ἀνιδρωτί. τοῦτο γὰρ ἡγεῖτο καὶ πρὸς τὸ ἡδέως ἐσθίειν ἀγαθὸν εἶναι καὶ πρὸς τὸ ὑγιαίνειν καὶ πρὸς τὸ δύνασθαι πονεῖν, καὶ πρὸς τὸ ἀλλήλοις δὲ πραιοτέρους εἶναι ἀγαθὸν ἡγεῖτο τοὺς πόνους εἶναι, ὅτι καὶ οἱ ἵπποι συμπονοῦντες ἀλλήλοις πραιότεροι συνεστήκασι. πρός γε μὴν τοὺς πολεμίους μεγαλοφρονέστεροι γίγνονται οἳ ἂν συνειδῶσιν ἑαυτοῖς εὖ ἠσκηκότες.

There was a further matter, to which he gave much care; he wished no man to take his meal at morning or at night till he had sweated for it. He would lead the men out to hunt, or invent games for them, or if there was work to be done, he would so conduct it that they did not leave it without sweat. He believed this regimen gave them zest for their food, was good for their health, and increased their powers of toil; and the toil itself was a blessed means for making the men more gentle towards each other; just as horses that work together grow gentle, and will stand quietly side by side. Moreover the knowledge of having gone through a common training would increase tenfold the courage with which they met the foe.

Κῦρος δ᾽ ἑαυτῶι σκηνὴν μὲν κατεσκευάσατο ὥστε ἱκανὴν ἔχειν οἷς καλοίη ἐπὶ δεῖπνον. ἐκάλει δὲ ὡς τὰ πολλὰ τῶν ταξιάρχων οὓς καιρὸς αὐτῶι δοκοίη εἶναι, ἔστι δ᾽ ὅτε καὶ τῶν λοχαγῶν καὶ τῶν δεκαδάρχων τινὰς καὶ τῶν πεμπαδάρχων ἐκάλει, ἔστι δ᾽ ὅτε καὶ τῶν στρατιωτῶν, ἔστι δ᾽ ὅτε καὶ πεμπάδα ὅλην καὶ δεκάδα ὅλην καὶ λόχον ὅλον καὶ τάξιν ὅλην. ἐκάλει δὲ καὶ ἐτίμα ὁπότε τινὰς ἴδοι τοιοῦτόν τι ποιήσαντας ὃ αὐτὸς ἐβούλετο ποιεῖν. ἦν δὲ τὰ παρατιθέμενα ἀεὶ ἴσα αὐτῶι τε καὶ τοῖς καλουμένοις ἐπὶ δεῖπνον.

Cyrus had his own quarters built to hold all the guests he might think it well to entertain, and, as a rule, he would invite such of the brigadiers as the occasion seemed to call for, but sometimes he would send for the company-captains and the officers in command of the smaller squads, and even the private soldiers were summoned to his board, and from time to time a squad of five, or of ten, or an entire company, or even a whole regiment, or he would give a special invitation by way of honour to any one whom he knew had undertaken some work he had at heart himself. In every case there was no distinction whatever between the meats for himself and for his guests.

καὶ τοὺς ἀμφὶ τὸ στράτευμα δὲ ὑπηρέτας ἰσομοίρους πάντων ἀεὶ ἐποίει· οὐδὲν γὰρ ἧττον τιμᾶν ἄξιον ἐδόκει αὐτῶι εἶναι τοὺς ἀμφὶ τὰ στρατιωτικὰ ὑπηρέτας οὔτε κηρύκων οὔτε πρέσβεων. καὶ γὰρ πιστοὺς ἡγεῖτο δεῖν εἶναι τούτους καὶ ἐπιστήμονας τῶν στρατιωτικῶν καὶ συνετούς, προσέτι δὲ καὶ σφοδροὺς καὶ ταχεῖς καὶ ἀόκνους καὶ ἀταράκτους. πρὸς δ᾽ ἔτι ἃ οἱ βέλτιστοι νομιζόμενοι ἔχουσιν ἐγίγνωσκεν ὁ Κῦρος δεῖν τοὺς ὑπηρέτας ἔχειν, καὶ τοῦτο ἀσκεῖν ὡς μηδὲν ἀναίνοιντο ἔργον, ἀλλὰ πάντα νομίζοιεν πρέπειν αὑτοῖς πράττειν ὅσα ἅρχων προστάττοι.

Further he always insisted that the army servants should share and share alike with the soldiers in everything, for he held that those who did such service for the army were as much to be honoured as heralds or ambassadors. They were bound, he said, to be loyal and intelligent, alive to all a soldier's needs, active, swift, unhesitating, and withal cool and imperturbable. Nor was that all; he was convinced that they ought also to possess those qualities which are thought to be peculiar to what we call "the better classes," and yet never despise their work, but feel that everything their commander laid upon them must be fit for them to do.
