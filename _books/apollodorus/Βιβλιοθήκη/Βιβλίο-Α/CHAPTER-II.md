### CHAPTER II

[1] ἐπειδὴ δὲ Ζεὺς ἐγενήθη τέλειος, λαμβάνει Μῆτιν τὴν Ὠκεανοῦ συνεργόν, ἣ δίδωσι Κρόνῳ καταπιεῖν φάρμακον, ὑφ᾽ οὗ ἐκεῖνος ἀναγκασθεὶς πρῶτον μὲν ἐξεμεῖ τὸν λίθον, ἔπειτα τοὺς παῖδας οὓς κατέπιε: μεθ᾽ ὧν Ζεὺς τὸν πρὸς Κρόνον καὶ Τιτᾶνας ἐξήνεγκε πόλεμον. μαχομένων δὲ αὐτῶν ἐνιαυτοὺς δέκα ἡ Γῆ τῷ Διὶ ἔχρησε τὴν νίκην, τοὺς καταταρταρωθέντας ἂν ἔχῃ συμμάχους: ὁ δὲ τὴν φρουροῦσαν αὐτῶν τὰ δεσμὰ Κάμπην ἀποκτείνας ἔλυσε. καὶ Κύκλωπες τότε Διὶ μὲν διδόασι βροντὴν καὶ ἀστραπὴν καὶ κεραυνόν, Πλούτωνι δὲ κυνέην, Ποσειδῶνι δὲ τρίαιναν: οἱ δὲ τούτοις ὁπλισθέντες κρατοῦσι Τιτάνων, καὶ καθείρξαντες αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ Ταρτάρῳ τοὺς ἑκατόγχειρας κατέστησαν φύλακας. αὐτοὶ δὲ διακληροῦνται περὶ τῆς ἀρχῆς, καὶ λαγχάνει Ζεὺς μὲν τὴν ἐν οὐρανῷ δυναστείαν, Ποσειδῶν δὲ τὴν ἐν θαλάσσῃ, Πλούτων δὲ τὴν ἐν Ἅιδου.

[1] But when Zeus was full-grown, he took Metis, daughter of Ocean, to help him, and she gave Cronus a drug to swallow, which forced him to disgorge first the stone and then the children whom he had swallowed, and with their aid Zeus waged the war against Cronus and the Titans. They fought for ten years, and Earth prophesied victory to Zeus if he should have as allies those who had been hurled down to Tartarus. So he slew their jailoress Campe, and loosed their bonds. And the Cyclopes then gave Zeus thunder and lightning and a thunderbolt, and on Pluto they bestowed a helmet and on Poseidon a trident. Armed with these weapons the gods overcame the Titans, shut them up in Tartarus, and appointed the Hundred-handers their guards; but they themselves cast lots for the sovereignty, and to Zeus was allotted the dominion of the sky, to Poseidon the dominion of the sea, and to Pluto the dominion in Hades.

[2] ἐγένοντο δὲ Τιτάνων ἔκγονοι Ὠκεανοῦ μὲν καὶ Τηθύος Ὠκεανίδες, Ἀσία Στὺξ Ἠλέκτρα Δωρὶς Εὐρονόμη Ἀμφιτρίτη Μῆτις, Κοίου δὲ καὶ Φοίβης Ἀστερία καὶ Λητώ, Ὑπερίονος δὲ καὶ Θείας Ἠὼς Ἥλιος Σελήνη, Κρείου δὲ καὶ Εὐρυβίας τῆς Πόντου Ἀστραῖος Πάλλας Πέρσης,

[2] Now to the Titans were born offspring: to Ocean and Tethys were born Oceanids, to wit, Asia, Styx, Electra, Doris, Eurynome, Amphitrite, and Metis; to Coeus and Phoebe were born Asteria and Latona; to Hyperion and Thia were born Dawn, Sun, and Moon; to Crius and Eurybia, daughter of Sea （ Pontus）, were born Astraeus, Pallas, and Perses;

[3] Ιαπετοῦ δὲ καὶ Ἀσίας Ἄτλας, ὃς ἔχει τοῖς ὤμοις τὸν οὐρανόν, καὶ Προμηθεὺς καὶ Ἐπιμηθεὺς καὶ Μενοίτιος, ὃν κεραυνώσας ἐν τῇ τιτανομαχία Ζεὺς κατεταρτάρωσεν.

[3] to Iapetus and Asia was born Atlas, who has the sky on his shoulders, and Prometheus, and Epimetheus, and Menoetius, he whom Zeus in the battle with the Titans smote with a thunderbolt and hurled down to Tartarus.

[4] ἐγένετο δὲ καὶ Κρόνου καὶ Φιλύρας Χείρων διφυὴς Κένταυρος, Ἠοῦς δὲ καὶ Ἀστραίου ἄνεμοι καὶ ἄστρα, Πέρσου δὲ καὶ Ἀστερίας Ἑκάτη, Πάλλαντος δὲ καὶ Στυγὸς Νίκη Κράτος Ζῆλος Βία.

[4] And to Cronus and Philyra was born Chiron, a centaur of double form; and to Dawn and Astraeus were born winds and stars; to Perses and Asteria was born Hecate; and to Pallas and Styx were born Victory, Dominion, Emulation, and Violence.

[5] τὸ δὲ τῆς Στυγὸς ὕδωρ ἐκ πέτρας ἐν Ἅιδου ῥέον Ζεὺς ἐποίησεν ὅρκον, ταύτην αὐτῇ τιμὴν διδοὺς ἀνθ᾽ ὧν αὐτῷ κατὰ Τιτάνων μετὰ τῶν τέκνων συνεμάχησε.

[5] But Zeus caused oaths to be sworn by the water of Styx, which flows from a rock in Hades, bestowing this honor on her because she and her children had fought on his side against the Titans.

[6] Πόντου δὲ καὶ Γῆς Φόρκος Θαύμας Νηρεὺς Εὐρυβία Κητώ. Θαύμαντος μὲν οὖν καὶ Ἠλέκτρας Ἶρις καὶ ἅρπυιαι, Ἀελλὼ καὶ Ὠκυπέτη, Φόρκου δὲ καὶ Κητοῦς Φορκίδες καὶ Γοργόνες, περὶ ὧν ἐροῦμεν ὅταν τὰ κατὰ Περσέα λέγωμεν,

[6] And to Sea （ Pontus） and Earth were born Phorcus, Thaumas, Nereus, Eurybia, and Ceto. Now to Thaumas and Electra were born Iris and the Harpies, Aello and Ocypete; and to Phorcus and Ceto were born the Phorcides and Gorgons, of whom we shall speak when we treat of Perseus.

[7] Νηρέως δὲ καὶ Δωρίδος Νηρηίδες, ὧν τὰ ὀνόματα Κυμοθόη Σπειὼ Γλαυκονόμη Ναυσιθόη Ἁλίη, Ἐρατὼ Σαὼ Ἀμφιτρίτη Εὐνίκη Θέτις, Εὐλιμένη Ἀγαύη Εὐδώρη Δωτὼ Φέρουσα, Γαλάτεια Ἀκταίη Ποντομέδουσα Ἱπποθόη Λυσιάνασσα, Κυμὼ Ἠιόνη Ἁλιμήδη Πληξαύρη Εὐκράντη, Πρωτὼ Καλυψὼ Πανόπη Κραντὼ Νεόμηρις, Ἱππονόη Ἰάνειρα Πολυνόμη Αὐτονόη Μελίτη, Διώνη Νησαίη Δηρὼ Εὐαγόρη Ψαμάθη, Εὐμόλπη Ἰόνη Δυναμένη Κητὼ Λιμνώρεια.

[7] To Nereus and Doris were born the Nereids, whose names are Cymothoe, Spio, Glauconome, Nausithoe, Halie, Erato, Sao, Amphitrite, Eunice, Thetis, Eulimene, Agave, Eudore, Doto, Pherusa, Galatea, Actaea, Pontomedusa, Hippothoe, Lysianassa, Cymo, Eione, Halimede, Plexaure, Eucrante, Proto, Calypso, Panope, Cranto, Neomeris, Hipponoe, Ianira, Polynome, Autonoe, Melite, Dione, Nesaea, Dero, Evagore, Psamathe, Eumolpe, Ione, Dynamene, Ceto, and Limnoria.
