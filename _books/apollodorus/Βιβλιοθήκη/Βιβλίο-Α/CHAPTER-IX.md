### CHAPTER IX

[1] τῶν δὲ Αἰόλου παίδων Ἀθάμας, Βοιωτίας δυναστεύων, ἐκ Νεφέλης τεκνοῖ παῖδα μὲν Φρίξον θυγατέρα δὲ Ἕλλην. αὖθις δὲ Ἰνὼ γαμεῖ, ἐξ ἧς αὐτῷ Λέαρχος καὶ Μελικέρτης ἐγένοντο. ἐπιβουλεύουσα δὲ Ἰνὼ τοῖς Νεφέλης τέκνοις ἔπεισε τὰς γυναῖκας τὸν πυρὸν φρύγειν. λαμβάνουσαι δὲ κρύφα τῶν ἀνδρῶν τοῦτο ἔπρασσον. γῆ δὲ πεφρυγμένους πυροὺς δεχομένη καρποὺς ἐτησίους οὐκ ἀνεδίδου. διὸ πέμπων ὁ Ἀθάμας εἰς Δελφοὺς ἀπαλλαγὴν ἐπυνθάνετο τῆς ἀφορίας. Ἰνὼ δὲ τοὺς πεμφθέντας ἀνέπεισε λέγειν ὡς εἴη κεχρησμένον παύσεσθαι τὴν ἀκαρπίαν, ἐὰν σφαγῇ Διὶ ὁ Φρίξος. τοῦτο ἀκούσας Ἀθάμας, συναναγκαζόμενος ὑπὸ τῶν τὴν γῆν κατοικούντων, τῷ βωμῷ παρέστησε Φρίξον. Νεφέλη δὲ μετὰ τῆς θυγατρὸς αὐτὸν ἀνήρπασε, καὶ παρ᾽ Ἑρμοῦ λαβοῦσα χρυσόμαλλον κριὸν ἔδωκεν, ὑφ᾽ οὗ φερόμενοι δι᾽ οὐρανοῦ γῆν ὑπερέβησαν καὶ θάλασσαν. ὡς δὲ ἐγένοντο κατὰ τὴν μεταξὺ κειμένην θάλασσαν Σιγείου καὶ Χερρονήσου, ὤλισθεν εἰς τὸν βυθὸν ἡ Ἕλλη, κἀκεῖ θανούσης αὐτῆς ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνης Ἑλλήσποντος ἐκλήθη τὸ πέλαγος. Φρίξος δὲ ἦλθεν εἰς Κόλχους, ὧν Αἰήτης ἐβασίλευε παῖς Ἡλίου καὶ Περσηίδος, ἀδελφὸς δὲ Κίρκης καὶ Πασιφάης, ἣν Μίνως ἔγημεν. οὗτος αὐτὸν ὑποδέχεται, καὶ μίαν τῶν θυγατέρων Χαλκιόπην δίδωσιν. ὁ δὲ τὸν χρυσόμαλλον κριὸν Διὶ θύει φυξίῳ, τὸ δὲ τούτου δέρας Αἰήτῃ δίδωσιν: ἐκεῖνος δὲ αὐτὸ περὶ δρῦν ἐν Ἄρεος ἄλσει καθήλωσεν. ἐγένοντο δὲ ἐκ Χαλκιόπης Φρίξῳ παῖδες Ἄργος Μέλας Φρόντις Κυτίσωρος.

[1] Of the sons of Aeolus, Athamas ruled over Boeotia and begat a son Phrixus and a daughter Helle by Nephele. And he married a second wife, Ino, by whom he had Learchus and Melicertes. But Ino plotted against the children of Nephele and persuaded the women to parch the wheat; and having got the wheat they did so without the knowledge of the men. But the earth, being sown with parched wheat, did not yield its annual crops; so Athamas sent to Delphi to inquire how he might be delivered from the dearth. Now Ino persuaded the messengers to say it was foretold that the infertility would cease if Phrixus were sacrificed to Zeus. When Athamas heard that, he was forced by the inhabitants of the land to bring Phrixus to the altar. But Nephele caught him and her daughter up and gave them a ram with a golden fleece, which she had received from Hermes, and borne through the sky by the ram they crossed land and sea. But when they were over the sea which lies betwixt Sigeum and the Chersonese, Helle slipped into the deep and was drowned, and the sea was called Hellespont after her. But Phrixus came to the Colchians, whose king was Aeetes, son of the Sun and of Perseis, and brother of Circe and Pasiphae, whom Minos married. He received Phrixus and gave him one of his daughters, Chalciope. And Phrixus sacrificed the ram with the golden fleece to Zeus the god of Escape, and the fleece he gave to Aeetes, who nailed it to an oak in a grove of Ares. And Phrixus had children by Chalciope, to wit, Argus, Melas, Phrontis, and Cytisorus.

[2] Ἀθάμας δὲ ὕστερον διὰ μῆνιν Ἥρας καὶ τῶν ἐξ Ἰνοῦς ἐστερήθη παίδων: αὐτὸς μὲν γὰρ μανεὶς ἐτόξευσε Λέαρχον, Ἰνὼ δὲ Μελικέρτην μεθ᾽ ἑαυτῆς εἰς πέλαγος ἔρριψεν. ἐκπεσὼν δὲ τῆς Βοιωτίας ἐπυνθάνετο τοῦ θεοῦ ποῦ κατοικήσει: χρησθέντος δὲ αὐτῷ κατοικεῖν ἐν ᾧπερ ἂν τόπῳ ὑπὸ ζῴων ἀγρίων ξενισθῇ, πολλὴν χώραν διελθὼν ἐνέτυχε λύκοις προβάτων μοίρας νεμομένοις: οἱ δέ, θεωρήσαντες αὐτόν, ἃ διῃροῦντο ἀπολιπόντες ἔφυγον. Ἀθάμας δὲ κτίσας τὴν χώραν Ἀθαμαντίαν ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ προσηγόρευσε, καὶ γήμας Θεμιστὼ τὴν Ὑψέως ἐγέννησε Λεύκωνα Ἐρύθριον Σχοινέα Πτῶον.

[2] But afterwards Athamas was bereft also of the children of Ino through the wrath of Hera; for he went mad and shot Learchus with an arrow, and Ino cast herself and Melicertes into the sea. Being banished from Boeotia, Athamas inquired of the god where he should dwell, and on receiving an oracle that he should dwell in whatever place he should be entertained by wild beasts, he traversed a great extent of country till he fell in with wolves that were devouring pieces of sheep; but when they saw him they abandoned their prey and fled. So Athamas settled in that country and named it Athamantia after himself; and he married Themisto, daughter of Hypseus, and begat Leucon, Erythrius, Schoeneus, and Ptous.

[3] Σίσυφος δὲ ὁ Αἰόλου κτίσας Ἐφύραν τὴν νῦν λεγομένην Κόρινθον γαμεῖ Μερόπην τὴν Ἄτλαντος. ἐξ αὐτῶν παῖς γίνεται Γλαῦκος, ᾧ παῖς Βελλεροφόντης ἐξ Εὐρυμέδης ἐγεννήθη, ὃς ἔκτεινε τὴν πυρίπνουν Χίμαιραν. κολάζεται δὲ Σίσυφος ἐν Ἅιδου πέτρον ταῖς χερσὶ καὶ τῇ κεφαλῇ κυλίων, καὶ τοῦτον ὑπερβάλλειν θέλων: οὗτος δὲ ὠθούμενος ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ ὠθεῖται πάλιν εἰς τοὐπίσω. τίνει δὲ ταύτην τὴν δίκην διὰ τὴν Ἀσωποῦ θυγατέρα Αἴγιναν: ἁρπάσαντα γὰρ αὐτὴν κρύφα Δία Ἀσωπῷ μηνῦσαι ζητοῦντι λέγεται.

[3] And Sisyphus, son of Aeolus, founded Ephyra, which is now called Corinth, and married Merope, daughter of Atlas. They had a son Glaucus, who had by Eurymede a son Bellerophon, who slew the fire breathing Chimera. But Sisyphus is punished in Hades by rolling a stone with his hands and head in the effort to heave it over the top; but push it as he will, it rebounds backward. This punishment he endures for the sake of Aegina, daughter of Asopus; for when Zeus had secretly carried her off, Sisyphus is said to have betrayed the secret to Asopus, who was looking for her.

[4] Δηιὼν δὲ βασιλεύων τῆς Φωκίδος Διομήδην τὴν Ξούθου γαμεῖ, καὶ αὐτῷ γίνεται θυγάτηρ μὲν Ἀστεροδία, παῖδες δὲ Αἰνετὸς Ἄκτωρ Φύλακος Κέφαλος, ὃς γαμεῖ Πρόκριν τὴν Ἐρεχθέως. αὖθις δὲ ἡ Ἠὼς αὐτὸν ἁρπάζει ἐρασθεῖσα.

[4] Deion reigned over Phocis and married Diomede, daughter of Xuthus; and there were born to him a daughter, Asterodia, and sons, Aenetus, Actor, Phylacus, and Cephalus, who married Procris, daughter of Erechtheus. But afterwards Dawn fell in love with him and carried him off.

[5] Περιήρης δὲ Μεσσήνην κατασχὼν Γοργοφόνην τὴν Περσέως ἔγημεν, ἐξ ἧς Ἀφαρεὺς αὐτῷ καὶ Λεύκιππος καὶ Τυνδάρεως ἔτι τε Ἰκάριος παῖδες ἐγένοντο. πολλοὶ δὲ τὸν Περιήρην λέγουσιν οὐκ Αἰόλου παῖδα ἀλλὰ Κυνόρτα τοῦ Ἀμύκλα: διόπερ τὰ περὶ τῶν Περιήρους ἐκγόνων ἐν τῷ Ἀτλαντικῷ γένει δηλώσομεν.

[5] Perieres took possession of Messene and married Gorgophone, daughter of Perseus, by whom he had sons, to wit, Aphareus and Leucippus, and Tyndareus, and also Icarius. But many say that Perieres was not the son of Aeolus but of Cynortas, son of Amyclas; so we shall narrate the history of the descendants of Perieres in dealing with the family of Atlas.

[6] Μάγνης δὲ γαμεῖ νύμφην νηίδα, καὶ γίνονται αὐτῷ παῖδες Πολυδέκτης καὶ Δίκτυς: οὗτοι Σέριφον ᾤκισαν.

[6] Magnes married a Naiad nymph, and sons were born to him, Polydectes and Dictys; these colonized Seriphus.

[7] Σαλμωνεὺς δὲ τὸ μὲν πρῶτον περὶ Θεσσαλίαν κατῴκει, παραγενόμενος δὲ αὖθις εἰς Ἦλιν ἐκεῖ πόλιν ἔκτισεν. ὑβριστὴς δὲ ὢν καὶ τῷ Διὶ ἐξισοῦσθαι θέλων διὰ τὴν ἀσέβειαν ἐκολάσθη: ἔλεγε γὰρ ἑαυτὸν εἶναι Δία, καὶ τὰς ἐκείνου θυσίας ἀφελόμενος ἑαυτῷ προσέτασσε θύειν, καὶ βύρσας μὲν ἐξηραμμένας ἐξ ἅρματος μετὰ λεβήτων χαλκῶν σύρων ἔλεγε βροντᾶν, βάλλων δὲ εἰς οὐρανὸν αἰθομένας λαμπάδας ἔλεγεν ἀστράπτειν. Ζεὺς δὲ αὐτὸν κεραυνώσας τὴν κτισθεῖσαν ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ πόλιν καὶ τοὺς οἰκήτορας ἠφάνισε πάντας.

[7] Salmoneus at first dwelt in Thessaly, but afterwards he came to Elis and there founded a city. And being arrogant and wishful to put himself on an equality with Zeus, he was punished for his impiety; for he said that he was himself Zeus, and he took away the sacrifices of the god and ordered them to be offered to himself; and by dragging dried hides, with bronze kettles, at his chariot, he said that he thundered, and by flinging lighted torches at the sky he said that he lightened. But Zeus struck him with a thunderbolt, and wiped out the city he had founded with all its inhabitants.

[8] Τυρὼ δὲ ἡ Σαλμωνέως θυγάτηρ καὶ Ἀλκιδίκης παρὰ Κρηθεῖ τῷ Σαλμωνέως ἀδελφῷ τρεφομένη ἔρωτα ἴσχει Ἐνιπέως τοῦ ποταμοῦ, καὶ συνεχῶς ἐπὶ τὰ τούτου ῥεῖθρα φοιτῶσα τούτοις ἐπωδύρετο. Ποσειδῶν δὲ εἰκασθεὶς Ἐνιπεῖ συγκατεκλίθη αὐτῇ: ἡ δὲ γεννήσασα κρύφα διδύμους παῖδας ἐκτίθησιν. ἐκκειμένων δὲ τῶν βρεφῶν, παριόντων ἱπποφορβῶν ἵππος μία προσαψαμένη τῇ χηλῇ θατέρου τῶν βρεφῶν πέλιόν τι τοῦ προσώπου μέρος ἐποίησεν. ὁ δὲ ἱπποφορβὸς ἀμφοτέρους τοὺς παῖδας ἀνελόμενος ἔθρεψε, καὶ τὸν μὲν πελιωθέντα Πελίαν ἐκάλεσε, τὸν δὲ ἕτερον Νηλέα. τελειωθέντες δὲ ἀνεγνώρισαν τὴν μητέρα, καὶ τὴν μητρυιὰν ἀπέκτειναν Σιδηρώ: κακουμένην γὰρ γνόντες ὑπ᾽ αὐτῆς τὴν μητέρα ὥρμησαν ἐπ᾽ αὐτήν, ἡ δὲ φθάσασα εἰς τὸ τῆς Ἥρας τέμενος κατέφυγε, Πελίας δὲ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῶν τῶν βωμῶν αὐτὴν κατέσφαξε, καὶ καθόλου διετέλει τὴν Ἥραν ἀτιμάζων.

[8] Now Tyro, daughter of Salmoneus and Alcidice, was brought up by Cretheus, brother of Salmoneus, and conceived a passion for the river Enipeus, and often would she hie to its running waters and utter her plaint to them. But Poseidon in the likeness of Enipeus lay with her, and she secretly gave birth to twin sons, whom she exposed. As the babes lay forlorn, a mare, belonging to some passing horsekeepers, kicked with its hoof one of the two infants and left a livid mark on its face. The horsekeeper took up both the children and reared them; and the one with the livid （pelion） mark he called Pelias, and the other Neleus. When they were grown up, they discovered their mother and killed their stepmother Sidero. For knowing that their mother was ill-used by her, they attacked her, but before they could catch her she had taken refuge in the precinct of Hera. However, Pelias cut her down on the very altars, and ever after he continued to treat Hera with contumely.

[9] ἐστασίασαν δὲ ὕστερον πρὸς ἀλλήλους, καὶ Νηλεὺς μὲν ἐκπεσὼν ἧκεν εἰς Μεσσήνην καὶ Πύλον κτίζει, καὶ γαμεῖ Χλωρίδα τὴν Ἀμφίονος, ἐξ ἧς αὐτῷ γίνεται θυγάτηρ μὲν Πηρώ, ἄρρενες δὲ Ταῦρος Ἀστέριος Πυλάων Δηίμαχος Εὐρύβιος Ἐπίλαος Φράσιος Εὐρυμένης Εὐαγόρας Ἀλάστωρ Νέστωρ Περικλύμενος, ᾧ δὴ καὶ Ποσειδῶν δίδωσι μεταβάλλειν τὰς μορφάς, καὶ μαχόμενος ὅτε Ἡρακλῆς ἐξεπόρθει Πύλον, γινόμενος ὁτὲ μὲν λέων ὁτὲ δὲ ὄφις ὁτὲ δὲ μέλισσα, ὑφ᾽ Ἡρακλέους μετὰ τῶν ἄλλων Νηλέως παίδων ἀπέθανεν. ἐσώθη δὲ Νέστωρ μόνος, ἐπειδὴ παρὰ Γερηνίοις ἐτρέφετο: ὃς γήμας Ἀναξιβίαν τὴν Κρατιέως θυγατέρας μὲν Πεισιδίκην καὶ Πολυκάστην ἐγέννησε, παῖδας δὲ Περσέα Στράτιχον Ἄρητον Ἐχέφρονα Πεισίστρατον Ἀντίλοχον Θρασυμήδην.

[9] But afterwards the brothers fell out, and Neleus, being banished, came to Messene, and founded Pylus, and married Chloris, daughter of Amphion, by whom he had a daughter, Pero, and sons, to wit, Taurus, Asterius, Pylaon, Deimachus, Eurybius, Epilaus, Phrasius, Eurymenes, Evagoras, Alastor, Nestor and Periclymenus, whom Poseidon granted the power of changing his shape. And when Hercules was ravaging Pylus, in the fight Periclymenus turned himself into a lion, a snake, and a bee, but was slain by Hercules with the other sons of Neleus. Nestor alone was saved, because he was brought up among the Gerenians. He married Anaxibia, daughter of Cratieus, and begat daughters, Pisidice and Polycaste, and sons, Perseus, Stratichus, Aretus, Echephron, Pisistratus, Antilochus, and Thrasymedes.

[10] Πελίας δὲ περὶ Θεσσαλίαν κατῴκει, καὶ γήμας Ἀναξιβίαν τὴν Βίαντος, ὡς δὲ ἔνιοι Φυλομάχην τὴν Ἀμφίονος, ἐγέννησε παῖδα μὲν Ἄκαστον, θυγατέρας δὲ Πεισιδίκην Πελόπειαν Ἱπποθόην Ἄλκηστιν.

[10] But Pelias dwelt in Thessaly and married Anaxibia, daughter of Bias, but according to some his wife was Phylomache, daughter of Amphion; and he begat a son, Acastus, and daughters, Pisidice, Pelopia, Hippothoe, and Alcestis.

[11] Κρηθεὺς δὲ κτίσας Ἰωλκὸν γαμεῖ Τυρὼ τὴν Σαλμωνέως, ἐξ ἧς αὐτῷ γίνονται παῖδες Αἴσων Ἀμυθάων Φέρης. Ἀμυθάων μὲν οὖν οἰκῶν Πύλον Εἰδομένην γαμεῖ τὴν Φέρητος, καὶ γίνονται παῖδες αὐτῷ Βίας καὶ Μελάμπους, ὃς ἐπὶ τῶν χωρίων διατελῶν, οὔσης πρὸ τῆς οἰκήσεως αὐτοῦ δρυὸς ἐν ᾗ φωλεὸς ὄφεων ὑπῆρχεν, ἀποκτεινάντων τῶν θεραπόντων τοὺς ὄφεις τὰ μὲν ἑρπετὰ ξύλα συμφορήσας ἔκαυσε, τοὺς δὲ τῶν ὄφεων νεοσσοὺς ἔθρεψεν. οἱ δὲ γενόμενοι τέλειοι παραστάντες αὐτῷ κοιμωμένῳ τῶν ὤμων ἐξ ἑκατέρου τὰς ἀκοὰς ταῖς γλώσσαις ἐξεκάθαιρον. ὁ δὲ ἀναστὰς καὶ γενόμενος περιδεὴς τῶν ὑπερπετομένων ὀρνέων τὰς φωνὰς συνίει, καὶ παρ᾽ ἐκείνων μανθάνων προύλεγε τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τὰ μέλλοντα. προσέλαβε δὲ καὶ τὴν διὰ τῶν ἱερῶν μαντικήν, περὶ δὲ τὸν Ἀλφειὸν συντυχὼν Ἀπόλλωνι τὸ λοιπὸν ἄριστος ἦν μάντις.

[11] Cretheus founded Iolcus and married Tyro, daughter of Salmoneus, by whom he had sons, Aeson, Amythaon, and Pheres. Amythaon dwelt in Pylus and married Idomene, daughter of Pheres, and there were born to him two sons, Bias and Melampus. The latter lived in the country, and before his house there was an oak, in which there was a lair of snakes. His servants killed the snakes, but Melampus gathered wood and burnt the reptiles, and reared the young ones. And when the young were full grown, they stood beside him at each of his shoulders as he slept, and they purged his ears with their tongues. He started up in a great fright, but understood the voices of the birds flying overhead, and from what he learned from them he foretold to men what should come to pass. He acquired besides the art of taking the auspices, and having fallen in with Apollo at the Alpheus he was ever after an excellent soothsayer.

[12] Βίας δὲ ἐμνηστεύετο Πηρὼ τὴν Νηλέως: ὁ δὲ πολλῶν αὐτῷ μνηστευομένων τὴν θυγατέρα δώσειν ἔφη τῷ τὰς Φυλάκου βόας κομίσαντι αὐτῷ. αὗται δὲ ἦσαν ἐν Φυλάκῃ, καὶ κύων ἐφύλασσεν αὐτὰς οὗ οὔτε ἄνθρωπος οὔτε θηρίον πέλας ἐλθεῖν ἠδύνατο. ταύτας ἀδυνατῶν Βίας τὰς βόας κλέψαι παρεκάλει τὸν ἀδελφὸν συλλαβέσθαι. Μελάμπους δὲ ὑπέσχετο, καὶ προεῖπεν ὅτι φωραθήσεται κλέπτων καὶ δεθεὶς ἐνιαυτὸν οὕτω τὰς βόας λήψεται. μετὰ δὲ τὴν ὑπόσχεσιν εἰς Φυλάκην ἀπῄει καί, καθάπερ προεῖπε, φωραθεὶς ἐπὶ τῇ κλοπῇ δέσμιος ἐν οἰκήματι ἐφυλάσσετο. λειπομένου δὲ τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ βραχέος χρόνου, τῶν κατὰ τὸ κρυφαῖον τῆς στέγης σκωλήκων ἀκούει, τοῦ μὲν ἐρωτῶντος πόσον ἤδη μέρος τοῦ δοκοῦ διαβέβρωται, τῶν δὲ ἀποκρινομένων λοιπὸν ἐλάχιστον εἶναι. καὶ ταχέως ἐκέλευσεν αὑτὸν εἰς ἕτερον οἴκημα μεταγαγεῖν, γενομένου δὲ τούτου μετ᾽ οὐ πολὺ συνέπεσε τὸ οἴκημα. θαυμάσας δὲ Φύλακος, καὶ μαθὼν ὅτι ἐστὶ μάντις ἄριστος, λύσας παρεκάλεσεν εἰπεῖν ὅπως αὐτοῦ τῷ παιδὶ Ἰφίκλῳ παῖδες γένωνται. ὁ δὲ ὑπέσχετο ἐφ᾽ ᾧ τὰς βόας λήψεται. καὶ καταθύσας ταύρους δύο καὶ μελίσας τοὺς οἰωνοὺς προσεκαλέσατο: παραγενομένου δὲ αἰγυπιοῦ, παρὰ τούτου μανθάνει δὴ ὅτι Φύλακός ποτε κριοὺς τέμνων ἐπὶ τῶν αἰδοίων παρὰ τῷ Ἰφίκλῳ τὴν μάχαιραν ᾑμαγμένην ἔτι κατέθετο, δείσαντος δὲ τοῦ παιδὸς καὶ φυγόντος αὖθις κατὰ τῆς ἱερᾶς δρυὸς αὐτὴν ἔπηξε, καὶ ταύτην ἀμφιτροχάσας ἐκάλυψεν ὁ φλοιός. ἔλεγεν οὖν, εὑρεθείσης τῆς μαχαίρας εἰ ξύων τὸν ἰὸν ἐπὶ ἡμέρας δέκα Ἰφίκλῳ δῷ πιεῖν, παῖδα γεννήσειν. ταῦτα μαθὼν παρ᾽ αἰγυπιοῦ Μελάμπους τὴν μὲν μάχαιραν εὗρε, τῷ δὲ Ἰφίκλῳ τὸν ἰὸν ξύσας ἐπὶ ἡμέρας δέκα δέδωκε πιεῖν, καὶ παῖς αὐτῷ Ποδάρκης ἐγένετο. τὰς δὲ βόας εἰς Πύλον ἤλασε, καὶ τῷ ἀδελφῷ τὴν Νηλέως θυγατέρα λαβὼν ἔδωκε. καὶ μέχρι μέν τινος ἐν Μεσσήνῃ κατῴκει, ὡς δὲ τὰς ἐν Ἄργει γυναῖκας ἐξέμηνε Διόνυσος, ἐπὶ μέρει τῆς βασιλείας ἰασάμενος αὐτὰς ἐκεῖ μετὰ Βίαντος κατῴκησε.

[12] Bias wooed Pero, daughter of Neleus. But as there were many suitors for his daughter’s hand, Neleus said that he would give her to him who should bring him the kine of Phylacus. These were in Phylace, and they were guarded by a dog which neither man nor beast could come near. Unable to steal these kine, Bias invited his brother to help him. Melampus promised to do so, and foretold that he should be detected in the act of stealing them, and that he should get the kine after being kept in bondage for a year. After making this promise he repaired to Phylace and, just as he had foretold, he was detected in the theft and kept a prisoner in a cell. When the year was nearly up, he heard the worms in the hidden part of the roof, one of them asking how much of the beam had been already gnawed through, and others answering that very little of it was left. At once he bade them transfer him to another cell, and not long after that had been done the cell fell in. Phylacus marvelled, and perceiving that he was an excellent soothsayer, he released him and invited him to say how his son Iphiclus might get children. Melampus promised to tell him, provided he got the kine. And having sacrificed two bulls and cut them in pieces he summoned the birds; and when a vulture came, he learned from it that once, when Phylacus was gelding rams, he laid down the knife, still bloody, beside Iphiclus, and that when the child was frightened and ran away, he stuck the knife on the sacred oak, and the bark encompassed the knife and hid it. He said, therefore, that if the knife were found, and he scraped off the rust, and gave it to Iphiclus to drink for ten days, he would beget a son. Having learned these things from the vulture, Melampus found the knife, scraped the rust, and gave it to Iphiclus for ten days to drink, and a son Podarces was born to him. But he drove the kine to Pylus, and having received the daughter of Neleus he gave her to his brother. For a time he continued to dwell in Messene, but when Dionysus drove the women of Argos mad, he healed them on condition of receiving part of the kingdom, and settled down there with Bias.

[13] Βίαντος δὲ καὶ Πηροῦς Ταλαός, οὗ καὶ Λυσιμάχης τῆς Ἄβαντος τοῦ Μελάμποδος Ἄδραστος Παρθενοπαῖος Πρῶναξ Μηκιστεὺς Ἀριστόμαχος Ἐριφύλη, ἣν Ἀμφιάραος γαμεῖ. Παρθενοπαίου δὲ Πρόμαχος ἐγένετο, ὃς μετὰ τῶν ἐπιγόνων ἐπὶ Θήβας ἐστρατεύθη, Μηκιστέως δὲ Εὐρύαλος, ὃς ἧκεν εἰς Τροίαν. Πρώνακτος δὲ ἐγένετο Λυκοῦργος, Ἀδράστου δὲ καὶ Ἀμφιθέας τῆς Πρώνακτος θυγατέρες μὲν Ἀργεία Δηιπύλη Αἰγιάλεια, παῖδες δὲ Αἰγιαλεὺς καὶ Κυάνιππος.

[13] Bias and Pero had a son Talaus, who married Lysimache, daughter of Abas, son of Melampus, and had by her Adrastus, Parthenopaeus, Pronax, Mecisteus, Aristomachus, and Eriphyle, whom Amphiaraus married. Parthenopaeus had a son Promachus, who marched with the Epigoni against Thebes; and Mecisteus had a son Euryalus, who went to Troy. Pronax had a son Lycurgus; and Adrastus had by Amphithea, daughter of Pronax, three daughters, Argia, Deipyle, and Aegialia, and two sons, Aegialeus and Cyanippus.

[14] Φέρης δὲ ὁ Κρηθέως Φερὰς ἐν Θεσσαλίᾳ κτίσας ἐγέννησεν Ἄδμητον καὶ Λυκοῦργον. Λυκοῦργος μὲν οὖν περὶ Νεμέαν κατῴκησε, γήμας δὲ Εὐρυδίκην, ὡς δὲ ἔνιοί φασιν Ἀμφιθέαν, ἐγέννησεν Ὀφέλτην τὸν ὕστερον κληθέντα Ἀρχέμορον.

[14] Pheres, son of Cretheus, founded Pherae in Thessaly and begat Admetus and Lycurgus. Lycurgus took up his abode at Nemea, and having married Eurydice, or, as some say, Amphithea, he begat Opheltes, afterwards called Archemorus.

[15] Ἀδμήτου δὲ βασιλεύοντος τῶν Φερῶν, ἐθήτευσεν Ἀπόλλων αὐτῷ μνηστευομένῳ τὴν Πελίου θυγατέρα Ἄλκηστιν. ἐκείνου δὲ δώσειν ἐπαγγειλαμένου τὴν θυγατέρα τῷ καταζεύξαντι ἅρμα λέοντος καὶ κάπρου, Ἀπόλλων ζεύξας ἔδωκεν: ὁ δὲ κομίσας πρὸς Πελίαν Ἄλκηστιν λαμβάνει. θύων δὲ ἐν τοῖς γάμοις ἐξελάθετο Ἀρτέμιδι θῦσαι: διὰ τοῦτο τὸν θάλαμον ἀνοίξας εὗρε δρακόντων σπειράμασι πεπληρωμένον. Ἀπόλλων δὲ εἰπὼν ἐξιλάσκεσθαι τὴν θεόν, ᾐτήσατο παρὰ μοιρῶν ἵνα, ὅταν Ἄδμητος μέλλῃ τελευτᾶν, ἀπολυθῇ τοῦ θανάτου, ἂν ἑκουσίως τις ὑπὲρ αὐτοῦ θνήσκειν ἕληται. ὡς δὲ ἦλθεν ἡ τοῦ θνήσκειν ἡμέρα, μήτε τοῦ πατρὸς μήτε τῆς μητρὸς ὑπὲρ αὐτοῦ θνήσκειν θελόντων, Ἄλκηστις ὑπεραπέθανε. καὶ αὐτὴν πάλιν ἀνέπεμψεν ἡ Κόρη, ὡς δὲ ἔνιοι λέγουσιν, Ἡρακλῆς πρὸς αὐτὸν ἀνεκόμισε μαχεσάμενος Ἅιδῃ.

[15] When Admetus reigned over Pherae, Apollo served him as his thrall, while Admetus wooed Alcestis, daughter of Pelias. Now Pelias had promised to give his daughter to him who should yoke a lion and a boar to a car, and Apollo yoked and gave them to Admetus, who brought them to Pelias and so obtained Alcestis. But in offering a sacrifice at his marriage, he forgot to sacrifice to Artemis; therefore when he opened the marriage chamber he found it full of coiled snakes. Apollo bade him appease the goddess and obtained as a favour of the Fates that, when Admetus should be about to die, he might be released from death if someone should choose voluntarily to die for him. And when the day of his death came neither his father nor his mother would die for him, but Alcestis died in his stead. But the Maiden sent her up again, or, as some say, Hercules fought with Hades and brought her up to him.

[16] Αἴσονος δὲ τοῦ Κρηθέως καὶ Πολυμήδης τῆς Αὐτολύκου Ἰάσων. οὗτος ᾤκει ἐν Ἰωλκῷ, τῆς δὲ Ἰωλκοῦ Πελίας ἐβασίλευσε μετὰ Κρηθέα, ᾧ χρωμένῳ περὶ τῆς βασιλείας ἐθέσπισεν ὁ θεὸς τὸν μονοσάνδαλον φυλάξασθαι. τὸ μὲν οὖν πρῶτον ἠγνόει τὸν χρησμόν, αὖθις δὲ ὕστερον αὐτὸν ἔγνω. τελῶν γὰρ ἐπὶ τῇ θαλάσσῃ Ποσειδῶνι θυσίαν ἄλλους τε πολλοὺς ἐπὶ ταύτῃ καὶ τὸν Ἰάσονα μετεπέμψατο. ὁ δὲ πόθῳ γεωργίας ἐν τοῖς χωρίοις διατελῶν ἔσπευσεν ἐπὶ τὴν θυσίαν: διαβαίνων δὲ ποταμὸν Ἄναυρον ἐξῆλθε μονοσάνδαλος, τὸ ἕτερον ἀπολέσας ἐν τῷ ῥείθρῳ πέδιλον. θεασάμενος δὲ Πελίας αὐτὸν καὶ τὸν χρησμὸν συμβαλὼν ἠρώτα προσελθών, τί ἂν ἐποίησεν ἐξουσίαν ἔχων, εἰ λόγιον ἦν αὐτῷ πρός τινος φονευθήσεσθαι τῶν πολιτῶν. ὁ δέ, εἴτε ἐπελθὸν ἄλλως, εἴτε διὰ μῆνιν Ἥρας, ἵν᾽ ἔλθοι κακὸν Μήδεια Πελίᾳ （τὴν γὰρ Ἥραν οὐκ ἐτίμα）, ‘τὸ χρυσόμαλλον δέρας’ ἔφη ‘προσέταττον ἂν φέρειν αὐτῷ.’ τοῦτο Πελίας ἀκούσας εὐθὺς ἐπὶ τὸ δέρας ἐλθεῖν ἐκέλευσεν αὐτόν. τοῦτο δὲ ἐν Κόλχοις ἦν ἐν Ἄρεος ἄλσει κρεμάμενον ἐκ δρυός, ἐφρουρεῖτο δὲ ὑπὸ δράκοντος ἀύπνου.ἐπὶ τοῦτο πεμπόμενος Ἰάσων Ἄργον παρεκάλεσε τὸν Φρίξου, κἀκεῖνος Ἀθηνᾶς ὑποθεμένης πεντηκόντορον ναῦν κατεσκεύασε τὴν προσαγορευθεῖσαν ἀπὸ τοῦ κατασκευάσαντος Ἀργώ: κατὰ δὲ τὴν πρῷραν ἐνήρμοσεν Ἀθηνᾶ φωνῆεν φηγοῦ τῆς Δωδωνίδος ξύλον. ὡς δὲ ἡ ναῦς κατεσκευάσθη, χρωμένῳ ὁ θεὸς αὐτῷ πλεῖν ἐπέτρεψε συναθροίσαντι τοὺς ἀρίστους τῆς Ἑλλάδος. οἱ δὲ συναθροισθέντες εἰσὶν οἵδε: Τῖφυς Ἁγνίου, ὃς ἐκυβέρνα τὴν ναῦν, Ὀρφεὺς Οἰάγρου, Ζήτης καὶ Κάλαϊς Βορέου, Κάστωρ καὶ Πολυδεύκης Διός, Τελαμὼν καὶ Πηλεὺς Αἰακοῦ, Ἡρακλῆς Διός, Θησεὺς Αἰγέως, Ἴδας καὶ Λυγκεὺς Ἀφαρέως, Ἀμφιάραος Ὀικλέους, Καινεὺς Κορώνου Παλαίμων Ἡφαίστου ἢ Αἰτωλοῦ, Κηφεὺς Ἀλεοῦ, Λαέρτης Ἀρκεισίου, Αὐτόλυκος Ἑρμοῦ, Ἀταλάντη Σχοινέως, Μενοίτιος Ἄκτορος, Ἄκτωρ Ἱππάσου, Ἄδμητος Φέρητος, Ἄκαστος Πελίου, Εὔρυτος Ἑρμοῦ, Μελέαγρος Οἰνέως, Ἀγκαῖος Λυκούργου, Εὔφημος Ποσειδῶνος, Ποίας Θαυμάκου, Βούτης Τελέοντος, Φᾶνος καὶ Στάφυλος Διονύσου, Ἐργῖνος Ποσειδῶνος, Περικλύμενος Νηλέως, Αὐγέας Ἡλίου, Ἴφικλος Θεστίου, Ἄργος Φρίξου, Εὐρύαλος Μηκιστέως, Πηνέλεως Ἱππάλμου, Λήιτος Ἀλέκτορος, Ἴφιτος Ναυβόλου, Ἀσκάλαφος καὶ Ἰάλμενος Ἄρεος, Ἀστέριος Κομήτου, Πολύφημος Ἐλάτου.

[16] Aeson, son of Cretheus, had a son Jason by Polymede, daughter of Autolycus. Now Jason dwelt in Iolcus, of which Pelias was king after Cretheus. But when Pelias consulted the oracle concerning the kingdom, the god warned him to beware of the man with a single sandal. At first the king understood not the oracle, but afterwards he apprehended it. For when he was offering a sacrifice at the sea to Poseidon, he sent for Jason, among many others, to participate in it. Now Jason loved husbandry and therefore abode in the country, but he hastened to the sacrifice, and in crossing the river Anaurus he lost a sandal in the stream and landed with only one. When Pelias saw him, he bethought him of the oracle, and going up to Jason asked him what, supposing he had the power, he would do if he had received an oracle that he should be murdered by one of the citizens. Jason answered, whether at haphazard or instigated by the angry Hera in order that Medea should prove a curse to Pelias, who did not honor Hera, “ I would command him,” said he, “ to bring the Golden Fleece. “ No sooner did Pelias hear that than he bade him go in quest of the fleece. Now it was at Colchis in a grove of Ares, hanging on an oak and guarded by a sleepless dragon.Sent to fetch the fleece, Jason called in the help of Argus, son of Phrixus; and Argus, by Athena’s advice, built a ship of fifty oars named Argo after its builder; and at the prow Athena fitted in a speaking timber from the oak of Dodona. When the ship was built, and he inquired of the oracle, the god gave him leave to assemble the nobles of Greece and sail away. And those who assembled were as follows: Tiphys, son of Hagnias, who steered the ship; Orpheus, son of Oeagrus; Zetes and Calais, sons of Boreas; Castor and Pollux, sons of Zeus; Telamon and Peleus, sons of Aeacus; Hercules, son of Zeus; Theseus, son of Aegeus; Idas and Lynceus, sons of Aphareus; Amphiaraus, son of Oicles; Caeneus, son of Coronus; Palaemon, son of Hephaestus or of Aetolus; Cepheus, son of Aleus; Laertes son of Arcisius; Autolycus, son of Hermes; Atalanta, daughter of Schoeneus; Menoetius, son of Actor; Actor, son of Hippasus; Admetus, son of Pheres; Acastus, son of Pelias; Eurytus, son of Hermes; Meleager, son of Oeneus; Ancaeus, son of Lycurgus; Euphemus, son of Poseidon; Poeas, son of Thaumacus; Butes, son of Teleon; Phanus and Staphylus, sons of Dionysus; Erginus, son of Poseidon; Periclymenus, son of Neleus; Augeas, son of the Sun; Iphiclus, son of Thestius; Argus, son of Phrixus; Euryalus, son of Mecisteus; Peneleos, son of Hippalmus; Leitus, son of Alector; Iphitus, son of Naubolus; Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of Ares; Asterius, son of Cometes; Polyphemus, son of Elatus.

[17] οὗτοι ναυαρχοῦντος Ἰάσονος ἀναχθέντες προσίσχουσι Λήμνῳ. ἔτυχε δὲ ἡ Λῆμνος ἀνδρῶν τότε οὖσα ἔρημος, βασιλευομένη δὲ ὑπὸ Ὑψιπύλης τῆς Θόαντος δι᾽ αἰτίαν τήνδε. αἱ Λήμνιαι τὴν Ἀφροδίτην οὐκ ἐτίμων: ἡ δὲ αὐταῖς ἐμβάλλει δυσοσμίαν, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο οἱ γήμαντες αὐτὰς ἐκ τῆς πλησίον Θρᾴκης λαβόντες αἰχμαλωτίδας συνευνάζοντο αὐταῖς. ἀτιμαζόμεναι δὲ αἱ Λήμνιαι τούς τε πατέρας καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας φονεύουσι: μόνη δὲ ἔσωσεν Ὑψιπύλη τὸν ἑαυτῆς πατέρα κρύψασα Θόαντα. προσσχόντες οὖν τότε γυναικοκρατουμένῃ τῇ Λήμνῳ μίσγονται ταῖς γυναιξίν. Ὑψιπύλη δὲ Ἰάσονι συνευνάζεται, καὶ γεννᾷ παῖδας Εὔνηον καὶ Νεβροφόνον.

[17] These with Jason as admiral put to sea and touched at Lemnos. At that time it chanced that Lemnos was bereft of men and ruled over by a queen, Hypsipyle, daughter of Thoas, the reason of which was as follows. The Lemnian women did not honor Aphrodite, and she visited them with a noisome smell; therefore their spouses took captive women from the neighboring country of Thrace and bedded with them. Thus dishonored, the Lemnian women murdered their fathers and husbands, but Hypsipyle alone saved her father Thoas by hiding him. So having put in to Lemnos, at that time ruled by women, the Argonauts had intercourse with the women, and Hypsipyle bedded with Jason and bore sons, Euneus and Nebrophonus.

[18] ἀπὸ Λήμνου δὲ προσίσχουσι Δολίοσιν, ὧν ἐβασίλευε Κύζικος. οὗτος αὐτοὺς ὑπεδέξατο φιλοφρόνως. νυκτὸς δὲ ἀναχθέντες ἐντεῦθεν καὶ περιπεσόντες ἀντιπνοίαις, ἀγνοοῦντες πάλιν τοῖς Δολίοσι προσίσχουσιν. οἱ δὲ νομίζοντες Πελασγικὸν εἶναι στρατόν （ἔτυχον γὰρ ὑπὸ Πελασγῶν συνεχῶς πολεμούμενοι） μάχην τῆς νυκτὸς συνάπτουσιν ἀγνοοῦντες πρὸς ἀγνοοῦντας. κτείναντες δὲ πολλοὺς οἱ Ἀργοναῦται, μεθ᾽ ὧν καὶ Κύζικον, μεθ᾽ ἡμέραν, ὡς ἔγνωσαν, ἀποδυράμενοι τάς τε κόμας ἐκείραντο καὶ τὸν Κύζικον πολυτελῶς ἔθαψαν. καὶ μετὰ τὴν ταφὴν πλεύσαντες Μυσίᾳ προσίσχουσιν.

[18] And after Lemnos they landed among the Doliones, of whom Cyzicus was king. He received them kindly. But having put to sea from there by night and met with contrary winds, they lost their bearings and landed again among the Doliones. However, the Doliones, taking them for a Pelasgian army （ for they were constantly harassed by the Pelasgians）, joined battle with them by night in mutual ignorance of each other. The Argonauts slew many and among the rest Cyzicus; but by day, when they knew what they had done, they mourned and cut off their hair and gave Cyzicus a costly burial; and after the burial they sailed away and touched at Mysia.

[19] ἐνταῦθα δὲ Ἡρακλέα καὶ Πολύφημον κατέλιπον. Ὕλας γὰρ ὁ Θειοδάμαντος παῖς, Ἡρακλέους δὲ ἐρώμενος, ἀποσταλεὶς ὑδρεύσασθαι διὰ κάλλος ὑπὸ νυμφῶν ἡρπάγη. Πολύφημος δὲ ἀκούσας αὐτοῦ βοήσαντος, σπασάμενος τὸ ξίφος ἐδίωκεν, ὑπὸ λῃστῶν ἄγεσθαι νομίζων. καὶ δηλοῖ συντυχόντι Ἡρακλεῖ. ζητούντων δὲ ἀμφοτέρων τὸν Ὕλαν ἡ ναῦς ἀνήχθη, καὶ Πολύφημος μὲν ἐν Μυσίᾳ κτίσας πόλιν Κίον ἐβασίλευσεν, Ἡρακλῆς δὲ ὑπέστρεψεν εἰς Ἄργος. Ἡρόδωρος δὲ αὐτὸν οὐδὲ τὴν ἀρχήν φησι πλεῦσαι τότε, ἀλλὰ παρ᾽ Ὀμφάλῃ δουλεύειν. Φερεκύδης δὲ αὐτὸν ἐν Ἀφεταῖς τῆς Θεσσαλίας ἀπολειφθῆναι λέγει, τῆς Ἀργοῦς φθεγξαμένης μὴ δύνασθαι φέρειν τὸ τούτου βάρος. Δημάρατος δὲ αὐτὸν εἰς Κόλχους πεπλευκότα παρέδωκε: Διονύσιος μὲν γὰρ αὐτὸν καὶ ἡγεμόνα φησὶ τῶν Ἀργοναυτῶν γενέσθαι.

[19] There they left Hercules and Polyphemus. For Hylas, son of Thiodamas, a minion of Hercules, had been sent to draw water and was ravished away by nymphs on account of his beauty. But Polyphemus heard him cry out, and drawing his sword gave chase in the belief that he was being carried off by robbers. Falling in with Hercules, he told him; and while the two were seeking for Hylas, the ship put to sea. So Polyphemus founded a city Cius in Mysia and reigned as king; but Hercules returned to Argos. However Herodorus says that Hercules did not sail at all at that time, but served as a slave at the court of Omphale. But Pherecydes says that he was left behind at Aphetae in Thessaly, the Argo having declared with human voice that she could not bear his weight. Nevertheless Demaratus has recorded that Hercules sailed to Colchis; for Dionysius even affirms that he was the leader of the Argonauts.

[20] ἀπὸ δὲ Μυσίας ἀπῆλθον εἰς τὴν Βεβρύκων γῆν, ἧς ἐβασίλευεν Ἄμυκος Ποσειδῶνος παῖς καὶ νύμφης Βιθυνίδος. γενναῖος δὲ ὢν οὗτος τοὺς προσσχόντας ξένους ἠνάγκαζε πυκτεύειν καὶ τοῦτον τὸν τρόπον ἀνῄρει. παραγενόμενος οὖν καὶ τότε ἐπὶ τὴν Ἀργὼ τὸν ἄριστον αὐτῶν εἰς πυγμὴν προεκαλεῖτο. Πολυδεύκης δὲ ὑποσχόμενος πυκτεύσειν πρὸς αὐτόν, πλήξας κατὰ τὸν ἀγκῶνα ἀπέκτεινε. τῶν δὲ Βεβρύκων ὁρμησάντων πρὸς αὐτόν, ἁρπάσαντες οἱ ἀριστεῖς τὰ ὅπλα πολλοὺς φεύγοντας φονεύουσιν αὐτῶν.

[20] From Mysia they departed to the land of the Bebryces, which was ruled by King Amycus, son of Poseidon and a Bithynian nymph. Being a doughty man he compelled the strangers that landed to box and in that way made an end of them. So going to the Argo as usual, he challenged the best man of the crew to a boxing match. Pollux undertook to box against him and killed him with a blow on the elbow. When the Bebryces made a rush at him, the chiefs snatched up their arms and put them to flight with great slaughter.

[21] ἐντεῦθεν ἀναχθέντες καταντῶσιν εἰς τὴν τῆς Θρᾴκης Σαλμυδησσόν, ἔνθα ᾤκει Φινεὺς μάντις τὰς ὄψεις πεπηρωμένος. τοῦτον οἱ μὲν Ἀγήνορος εἶναι λέγουσιν, οἱ δὲ Ποσειδῶνος υἱόν: καὶ πηρωθῆναί φασιν αὐτὸν οἱ μὲν ὑπὸ θεῶν, ὅτι προέλεγε τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τὰ μέλλοντα, οἱ δὲ ὑπὸ Βορέου καὶ τῶν Ἀργοναυτῶν, ὅτι πεισθεὶς μητρυιᾷ τοὺς ἰδίους ἐτύφλωσε παῖδας, τινὲς δὲ ὑπὸ Ποσειδῶνος, ὅτι τοῖς Φρίξου παισὶ τὸν ἐκ Κόλχων εἰς τὴν Ἑλλάδα πλοῦν ἐμήνυσεν. ἔπεμψαν δὲ αὐτῷ καὶ τὰς ἁρπυίας οἱ θεοί: πτερωταὶ δὲ ἦσαν αὗται, καὶ ἐπειδὴ τῷ Φινεῖ παρετίθετο τράπεζα, ἐξ οὐρανοῦ καθιπτάμεναι τὰ μὲν πλείονα ἀνήρπαζον, ὀλίγα δὲ ὅσα ὀσμῆς ἀνάπλεα κατέλειπον, ὥστε μὴ δύνασθαι προσενέγκασθαι. βουλομένοις δὲ τοῖς Ἀργοναύταις τὰ περὶ τοῦ πλοῦ μαθεῖν ὑποθήσεσθαι τὸν πλοῦν ἔφη, τῶν ἁρπυιῶν αὐτὸν ἐὰν ἀπαλλάξωσιν. οἱ δὲ παρέθεσαν αὐτῷ τράπεζαν ἐδεσμάτων, ἅρπυιαι δὲ ἐξαίφνης σὺν βοῇ καταπτᾶσαι τὴν τροφὴν ἥρπασαν. θεασάμενοι δὲ οἱ Βορέου παῖδες Ζήτης καὶ Κάλαϊς, ὄντες πτερωτοί, σπασάμενοι τὰ ξίφη δι᾽ ἀέρος ἐδίωκον. ἦν δὲ ταῖς ἁρπυίαις χρεὼν τεθνάναι ὑπὸ τῶν Βορέου παίδων, τοῖς δὲ Βορέου παισὶ τότε τελευτήσειν ὅταν διώκοντες μὴ καταλάβωσι. διωκομένων δὲ τῶν ἁρπυιῶν ἡ μὲν κατὰ Πελοπόννησον εἰς τὸν Τίγρην ποταμὸν ἐμπίπτει, ὃς νῦν ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνης Ἅρπυς καλεῖται: ταύτην δὲ οἱ μὲν Νικοθόην οἱ δὲ Ἀελλόπουν καλοῦσιν. ἡ δὲ ἑτέρα καλουμένη Ὠκυπέτη, ὡς δὲ ἔνιοι Ὠκυθόη （Ἡσίοδος δὲ λέγει αὐτὴν Ὠκυπόδην）, αὕτη κατὰ τὴν Προποντίδα φεύγουσα μέχρις Ἐχινάδων ἦλθε νήσων, αἳ νῦν ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνης Στροφάδες καλοῦνται: ἐστράφη γὰρ ὡς ἦλθεν ἐπὶ ταύτας, καὶ γενομένη κατὰ τὴν ἠιόνα ὑπὸ καμάτου πίπτει σὺν τῷ διώκοντι. Ἀπολλώνιος δὲ ἐν τοῖς Ἀργοναύταις ἕως Στροφάδων νήσων φησὶν αὐτὰς διωχθῆναι καὶ μηδὲν παθεῖν, δούσας ὅρκον τὸν Φινέα μηκέτι ἀδικῆσαι.

[21] Thence they put to sea and came to land at Salmydessus in Thrace, where dwelt Phineus, a seer who had lost the sight of both eyes. Some say he was a son of Agenor, but others that he was a son of Poseidon, and he is variously alleged to have been blinded by the gods for foretelling men the future; or by Boreas and the Argonauts because he blinded his own sons at the instigation of their stepmother; or by Poseidon, because he revealed to the children of Phrixus how they could sail from Colchis to Greece. The gods also sent the Harpies to him. These were winged female creatures, and when a table was laid for Phineus, they flew down from the sky and snatched up most of the victuals, and what little they left stank so that nobody could touch it. When the Argonauts would have consulted him about the voyage, he said that he would advise them about it if they would rid him of the Harpies. So the Argonauts laid a table of viands beside him, and the Harpies with a shriek suddenly pounced down and snatched away the food. When Zetes and Calais, the sons of Boreas, saw that, they drew their swords and, being winged, pursued them through the air. Now it was fated that the Harpies should perish by the sons of Boreas, and that the sons of Boreas should die when they could not catch up a fugitive. So the Harpies were pursued and one of them fell into the river Tigres in Peloponnese, the river that is now called Harpys after her; some call her Nicothoe, but others Aellopus. But the other, named Ocypete or, according to others, Ocythoe （ but Hesiod calls her Ocypode） fled by the Propontis till she came to the Echinadian Islands, which are now called Strophades after her; for when she came to them she turned （estraphe） and being at the shore fell for very weariness with her pursuer. But Apollonius in the Argonautica says that the Harpies were pursued to the Strophades Islands and suffered no harm, having sworn an oath that they would wrong Phineus no more.

[22] ἀπαλλαγεὶς δὲ τῶν ἁρπυιῶν Φινεὺς ἐμήνυσε τὸν πλοῦν τοῖς Ἀργοναύταις, καὶ περὶ τῶν συμπληγάδων ὑπέθετο πετρῶν τῶν κατὰ θάλασσαν. ἦσαν δὲ ὑπερμεγέθεις αὗται, συγκρουόμεναι δὲ ἀλλήλαις ὑπὸ τῆς τῶν πνευμάτων βίας τὸν διὰ θαλάσσης πόρον ἀπέκλειον. ἐφέρετο δὲ πολλὴ μὲν ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν ὁμίχλη πολὺς δὲ πάταγος, ἦν δὲ ἀδύνατον καὶ τοῖς πετεινοῖς δι᾽ αὐτῶν διελθεῖν. εἶπεν οὖν αὐτοῖς ἀφεῖναι πελειάδα διὰ τῶν πετρῶν, καὶ ταύτην ἐὰν μὲν ἴδωσι σωθεῖσαν, διαπλεῖν καταφρονοῦντας, ἐὰν δὲ ἀπολομένην, μὴ πλεῖν βιάζεσθαι. ταῦτα ἀκούσαντες ἀνήγοντο, καὶ ὡς πλησίον ἦσαν τῶν πετρῶν, ἀφιᾶσιν ἐκ τῆς πρῴρας πελειάδα: τῆς δὲ ἱπταμένης τὰ ἄκρα τῆς οὐρᾶς ἡ σύμπτωσις τῶν πετρῶν ἀπεθέρισεν. ἀναχωρούσας οὖν ἐπιτηρήσαντες τὰς πέτρας μετ᾽ εἰρεσίας ἐντόνου, συλλαβομένης Ἥρας, διῆλθον, τὰ ἄκρα τῶν ἀφλάστων τῆς νεὼς περικοπείσης. αἱ μὲν οὖν συμπληγάδες ἔκτοτε ἔστησαν: χρεὼν γὰρ ἦν αὐταῖς νεὼς περαιωθείσης στῆναι παντελῶς.

[22] Being rid of the Harpies, Phineus revealed to the Argonauts the course of their voyage, and advised them about the Clashing Rocks in the sea. These were huge cliffs, which, dashed together by the force of the winds, closed the sea passage. Thick was the mist that swept over them, and loud the crash, and it was impossible for even the birds to pass between them. So he told them to let fly a dove between the rocks, and, if they saw it pass safe through, to thread the narrows with an easy mind, but if they saw it perish, then not to force a passage. When they heard that, they put to sea, and on nearing the rocks let fly a dove from the prow, and as she flew the clash of the rocks nipped off the tip of her tail. So, waiting till the rocks had recoiled, with hard rowing and the help of Hera, they passed through, the extremity of the ship’s ornamented poop being shorn away right round. Henceforth the Clashing Rocks stood still; for it was fated that, so soon as a ship had made the passage, they should come to rest completely.

[23] οἱ δὲ Ἀργοναῦται πρὸς Μαριανδυνοὺς παρεγένοντο, κἀκεῖ φιλοφρόνως ὁ βασιλεὺς ὑπεδέξατο Λύκος. ἔνθα θνήσκει μὲν Ἴδμων ὁ μάντις πλήξαντος αὐτὸν κάπρου, θνήσκει δὲ καὶ Τῖφυς, καὶ τὴν ναῦν Ἀγκαῖος ὑπισχνεῖται κυβερνᾶν.παραπλεύσαντες δὲ Θερμώδοντα καὶ Καύκασον ἐπὶ Φᾶσιν ποταμὸν ἦλθον: οὗτος τῆς Κολχικῆς ἐστιν. ἐγκαθορμισθείσης δὲ τῆς νεὼς ἧκε πρὸς Αἰήτην Ἰάσων, καὶ τὰ ἐπιταγέντα ὑπὸ Πελίου λέγων παρεκάλει δοῦναι τὸ δέρας αὐτῷ: ὁ δὲ δώσειν ὑπέσχετο, ἐὰν τοὺς χαλκόποδας ταύρους μόνος καταζεύξῃ. ἦσαν δὲ ἄγριοι παρ᾽ αὐτῷ ταῦροι δύο, μεγέθει διαφέροντες, δῶρον Ἡφαίστου, οἳ χαλκοῦς μὲν εἶχον πόδας, πῦρ δὲ ἐκ στομάτων ἐφύσων. τούτους αὐτῷ ζεύξαντι ἐπέτασσε σπείρειν δράκοντος ὀδόντας: εἶχε γὰρ λαβὼν παρ᾽ Ἀθηνᾶς τοὺς ἡμίσεις ὧν Κάδμος ἔσπειρεν ἐν Θήβαις. ἀποροῦντος δὲ τοῦ Ἰάσονος πῶς ἂν δύναιτο τοὺς ταύρους καταζεῦξαι, Μήδεια αὐτοῦ ἔρωτα ἴσχει: ἦν δὲ αὕτη θυγάτηρ Αἰήτου καὶ Εἰδυίας τῆς Ὠκεανοῦ, φαρμακίς. δεδοικυῖα δὲ μὴ πρὸς τῶν ταύρων διαφθαρῇ, κρύφα τοῦ πατρὸς συνεργήσειν αὐτῷ πρὸς τὴν κατάζευξιν τῶν ταύρων ἐπηγγείλατο καὶ τὸ δέρας ἐγχειριεῖν, ἐὰν ὀμόσῃ αὐτὴν ἕξειν γυναῖκα καὶ εἰς Ἑλλάδα σύμπλουν ἀγάγηται. ὀμόσαντος δὲ Ἰάσονος φάρμακον δίδωσιν, ᾧ καταζευγνύναι μέλλοντα τοὺς ταύρους ἐκέλευσε χρῖσαι τήν τε ἀσπίδα καὶ τὸ δόρυ καὶ τὸ σῶμα: τούτῳ γὰρ χρισθέντα ἔφη πρὸς μίαν ἡμέραν μήτ᾽ ἂν ὑπὸ πυρὸς ἀδικηθήσεσθαι μήτε ὑπὸ σιδήρου. ἐδήλωσε δὲ αὐτῷ σπειρομένων τῶν ὀδόντων ἐκ γῆς ἄνδρας μέλλειν ἀναδύεσθαι ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν καθωπλισμένους, οὓς ἔλεγεν ἐπειδὰν ἀθρόους θεάσηται, βάλλειν εἰς μέσον λίθους ἄποθεν, ὅταν δὲ ὑπὲρ τούτου μάχωνται πρὸς ἀλλήλους, τότε κτείνειν αὐτούς. Ἰάσων δὲ τοῦτο ἀκούσας καὶ χρισάμενος τῷ φαρμάκῳ, παραγενόμενος εἰς τὸ τοῦ νεὼ ἄλσος ἐμάστευε τοὺς ταύρους, καὶ σὺν πολλῷ πυρὶ ὁρμήσαντας αὐτοὺς κατέζευξε. σπείραντος δὲ αὐτοῦ τοὺς ὀδόντας ἀνέτελλον ἐκ τῆς γῆς ἄνδρες ἔνοπλοι: ὁ δὲ ὅπου πλείονας ἑώρα, βάλλων ἀφανῶς λίθους, πρὸς αὐτοὺς μαχομένους πρὸς ἀλλήλους προσιὼν ἀνῄρει. καὶ κατεζευγμένων τῶν ταύρων οὐκ ἐδίδου τὸ δέρας Αἰήτης, ἐβούλετο δὲ τήν τε Ἀργὼ καταφλέξαι καὶ κτεῖναι τοὺς ἐμπλέοντας. φθάσασα δὲ Μήδεια τὸν Ἰάσονα νυκτὸς ἐπὶ τὸ δέρας ἤγαγε, καὶ τὸν φυλάσσοντα δράκοντα κατακοιμίσασα τοῖς φαρμάκοις μετὰ Ἰάσονος, ἔχουσα τὸ δέρας, ἐπὶ τὴν Ἀργὼ παρεγένετο. συνείπετο δὲ αὐτῇ καὶ ὁ ἀδελφὸς Ἄψυρτος. οἱ δὲ νυκτὸς μετὰ τούτων ἀνήχθησαν.

[23] The Argonauts now arrived among the Mariandynians, and there King Lycus received them kindly. There died Idmon the seer of a wound inflicted by a boar; and there too died Tiphys, and Ancaeus undertook to steer the ship.And having sailed past the Thermodon and the Caucasus they came to the river Phasis, which is in the Colchian land. When the ship was brought into port, Jason repaired to Aeetes, and setting forth the charge laid on him by Pelias invited him to give him the fleece. The other promised to give it if single-handed he would yoke the brazen-footed bulls. These were two wild bulls that he had, of enormous size, a gift of Hephaestus; they had brazen feet and puffed fire from their mouths. These creatures Aeetes ordered him to yoke and to sow dragon’s teeth; for he had got from Athena half of the dragon’s teeth which Cadmus sowed in Thebes. While Jason puzzled how he could yoke the bulls, Medea conceived a passion for him; now she was a witch, daughter of Aeetes and Idyia, daughter of Ocean. And fearing lest he might be destroyed by the bulls, she, keeping the thing from her father, promised to help him to yoke the bulls and to deliver to him the fleece, if he would swear to have her to wife and would take her with him on the voyage to Greece. When Jason swore to do so, she gave him a drug with which she bade him anoint his shield, spear, and body when he was about to yoke the bulls; for she said that, anointed with it, he could for a single day be harmed neither by fire nor by iron. And she signified to him that, when the teeth were sown, armed men would spring up from the ground against him; and when he saw a knot of them he was to throw stones into their midst from a distance, and when they fought each other about that, he was taken to kill them. On hearing that, Jason anointed himself with the drug, and being come to the grove of the temple he sought the bulls, and though they charged him with a flame of fire, he yoked them. And when he had sowed the teeth, there rose armed men from the ground; and where he saw several together, he pelted them unseen with stones, and when they fought each other he drew near and slew them. But though the bulls were yoked, Aeetes did not give the fleece; for he wished to burn down the Argo and kill the crew. But before he could do so, Medea brought Jason by night to the fleece, and having lulled to sleep by her drugs the dragon that guarded it, she possessed herself of the fleece and in Jason’s company came to the Argo. She was attended, too, by her brother Apsyrtus. And with them the Argonauts put to sea by night.

[24] Αἰήτης δὲ ἐπιγνοὺς τὰ τῇ Μηδείᾳ τετολμημένα ὥρμησε τὴν ναῦν διώκειν. ἰδοῦσα δὲ αὐτὸν πλησίον ὄντα Μήδεια τὸν ἀδελφὸν φονεύει καὶ μελίσασα κατὰ τοῦ βυθοῦ ῥίπτει. συναθροίζων δὲ Αἰήτης τὰ τοῦ παιδὸς μέλη τῆς διώξεως ὑστέρησε: διόπερ ὑποστρέψας, καὶ τὰ σωθέντα τοῦ παιδὸς μέλη θάψας, τὸν τόπον προσηγόρευσε Τόμους. πολλοὺς δὲ τῶν Κόλχων ἐπὶ τὴν ζήτησιν τῆς Ἀργοῦς ἐξέπεμψεν, ἀπειλήσας, εἰ μὴ Μήδειαν ἄξουσιν, αὐτοὺς πείσεσθαι τὰ ἐκείνης. οἱ δὲ σχισθέντες ἄλλος ἀλλαχοῦ ζήτησιν ἐποιοῦντο.τοῖς δὲ Ἀργοναύταις τὸν Ἠριδανὸν ποταμὸν ἤδη παραπλέουσι Ζεὺς μηνίσας ὑπὲρ τοῦ φονευθέντος Ἀψύρτου χειμῶνα λάβρον ἐπιπέμψας ἐμβάλλει πλάνην. καὶ αὐτῶν τὰς Ἀψυρτίδας νήσους παραπλεόντων ἡ ναῦς φθέγγεται μὴ λήξειν τὴν ὀργὴν τοῦ Διός, ἐὰν μὴ πορευθέντες εἰς τὴν Αὐσονίαν τὸν Ἀψύρτου φόνον καθαρθῶσιν ὑπὸ Κίρκης. οἱ δὲ παραπλεύσαντες τὰ Λιγύων καὶ Κελτῶν ἔθνη, καὶ διὰ τοῦ Σαρδονίου πελάγους διακομισθέντες, παραμειψάμενοι Τυρρηνίαν ἦλθον εἰς Αἰαίην, ἔνθα Κίρκης ἱκέται γενόμενοι καθαίρονται.

[24] When Aeetes discovered the daring deeds done by Medea, he started off in pursuit of the ship; but when she saw him near, Medea murdered her brother and cutting him limb from limb threw the pieces into the deep. Gathering the child’s limbs, Aeetes fell behind in the pursuit; wherefore he turned back, and, having buried the rescued limbs of his child, he called the place Tomi. But he sent out many of the Colchians to search for the Argo, threatening that, if they did not bring Medea to him, they should suffer the punishment due to her; so they separated and pursued the search in divers places.When the Argonauts were already sailing past the Eridanus river, Zeus sent a furious storm upon them, and drove them out of their course, because he was angry at the murder of Apsyrtus. And as they were sailing past the Apsyrtides Islands, the ship spoke, saying that the wrath of Zeus would not cease unless they journeyed to Ausonia and were purified by Circe for the murder of Apsyrtus. So when they had sailed past the Ligurian and Celtic nations and had voyaged through the Sardinian Sea, they skirted Tyrrhenia and came to Aeaea, where they supplicated Circe and were purified.

[25] παραπλεόντων δὲ Σειρῆνας αὐτῶν, Ὀρφεὺς τὴν ἐναντίαν μοῦσαν μελῳδῶν τοὺς Ἀργοναύτας κατέσχε. μόνος δὲ Βούτης ἐξενήξατο πρὸς αὐτάς, ὃν ἁρπάσασα Ἀφροδίτη ἐν Λιλυβαίῳ κατῴκισε.μετὰ δὲ τὰς Σειρῆνας τὴν ναῦν Χάρυβδις ἐξεδέχετο καὶ Σκύλλα καὶ πέτραι πλαγκταί, ὑπὲρ ὧν φλὸξ πολλὴ καὶ καπνὸς ἀναφερόμενος ἑωρᾶτο. ἀλλὰ διὰ τούτων διεκόμισε τὴν ναῦν σὺν Νηρηίσι Θέτις παρακληθεῖσα ὑπὸ Ἥρας.παραμειψάμενοι δὲ Θρινακίαν νῆσον Ἡλίου βοῦς ἔχουσαν εἰς τὴν Φαιάκων νῆσον Κέρκυραν ἧκον, ἧς βασιλεὺς ἦν Ἀλκίνοος. τῶν δὲ Κόλχων τὴν ναῦν εὑρεῖν μὴ δυναμένων οἱ μὲν τοῖς Κεραυνίοις ὄρεσι παρῴκησαν, οἱ δὲ εἰς τὴν Ἰλλυρίδα κομισθέντες ἔκτισαν Ἀψυρτίδας νήσους: ἔνιοι δὲ πρὸς Φαίακας ἐλθόντες τὴν Ἀργὼ κατέλαβον καὶ τὴν Μήδειαν ἀπῄτουν παρ᾽ Ἀλκινόου. ὁ δὲ εἶπεν, εἰ μὲν ἤδη συνελήλυθεν Ἰάσονι, δώσειν αὐτὴν ἐκείνῳ, εἰ δ᾽ ἔτι παρθένος ἐστί, τῷ πατρὶ ἀποπέμψειν. Ἀρήτη δὲ ἡ Ἀλκινόου γυνὴ φθάσασα Μήδειαν Ἰάσονι συνέζευξεν: ὅθεν οἱ μὲν Κόλχοι μετὰ Φαιάκων κατῴκησαν, οἱ δὲ Ἀργοναῦται μετὰ τῆς Μηδείας ἀνήχθησαν.

[25] And as they sailed past the Sirens, Orpheus restrained the Argonauts by chanting a counter-melody. Butes alone swam off to the Sirens, but Aphrodite carried him away and settled him in Lilybaeum.After the Sirens, the ship encountered Charybdis and Scylla and the Wandering Rocks, above which a great flame and smoke were seen rising. But Thetis with the Nereids steered the ship through them at the summons of Hera.Having passed by the Island of Thrinacia, where are the kine of the Sun, they came to Corcyra, the island of the Phaeacians, of which Alcinous was king. But when the Colchians could not find the ship, some of them settled at the Ceraunian mountains, and some journeyed to Illyria and colonized the Apsyrtides Islands. But some came to the Phaeacians, and finding the Argo there, they demanded of Alcinous that he should give up Medea. He answered, that if she already knew Jason, he would give her to him, but that if she were still a maid he would send her away to her father. However, Arete, wife of Alcinous, anticipated matters by marrying Medea to Jason; hence the Colchians settled down among the Phaeacians and the Argonauts put to sea with Medea.

[26] πλέοντες δὲ νυκτὸς σφοδρῷ περιπίπτουσι χειμῶνι. Ἀπόλλων δὲ στὰς ἐπὶ τὰς Μελαντίους δειράς, τοξεύσας τῷ βέλει εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν κατήστραψεν. οἱ δὲ πλησίον ἐθεάσαντο νῆσον, τῷ δὲ παρὰ προσδοκίαν ἀναφανῆναι προσορμισθέντες Ἀνάφην ἐκάλεσαν: ἱδρυσάμενοι δὲ βωμὸν Ἀπόλλωνος αἰγλήτου καὶ θυσιάσαντες ἐπ᾽ εὐωχίαν ἐτράπησαν. δοθεῖσαι δ᾽ ὑπὸ Ἀρήτης Μηδείᾳ δώδεκα θεράπαιναι τοὺς ἀριστέας ἔσκωπτον μετὰ παιγνίας: ὅθεν ἔτι καὶ νῦν ἐν τῇ θυσίᾳ σύνηθές ἐστι σκώπτειν ταῖς γυναιξίν.ἐντεῦθεν ἀναχθέντες κωλύονται Κρήτῃ προσίσχειν ὑπὸ Τάλω. τοῦτον οἱ μὲν τοῦ χαλκοῦ γένους εἶναι λέγουσιν, οἱ δὲ ὑπὸ Ἡφαίστου Μίνωι δοθῆναι: ὃς ἦν χαλκοῦς ἀνήρ, οἱ δὲ ταῦρον αὐτὸν λέγουσιν. εἶχε δὲ φλέβα μίαν ἀπὸ αὐχένος κατατείνουσαν ἄχρι σφυρῶν: κατὰ δὲ τὸ τέρμα τῆς φλεβὸς ἧλος διήρειστο χαλκοῦς. οὗτος ὁ Τάλως τρὶς ἑκάστης ἡμέρας τὴν νῆσον περιτροχάζων ἐτήρει: διὸ καὶ τότε τὴν Ἀργὼ προσπλέουσαν θεωρῶν τοῖς λίθοις ἔβαλλεν. ἐξαπατηθεὶς δὲ ὑπὸ Μηδείας ἀπέθανεν, ὡς μὲν ἔνιοι λέγουσι, διὰ φαρμάκων αὐτῷ μανίαν Μηδείας ἐμβαλούσης, ὡς δέ τινες, ὑποσχομένης ποιήσειν ἀθάνατον καὶ τὸν ἧλον ἐξελούσης, ἐκρυέντος τοῦ παντὸς ἰχῶρος αὐτὸν ἀποθανεῖν. τινὲς δὲ αὐτὸν τοξευθέντα ὑπὸ Ποίαντος εἰς τὸ σφυρὸν τελευτῆσαι λέγουσι.μίαν δὲ ἐνταῦθα νύκτα μείναντες Αἰγίνῃ προσίσχουσιν ὑδρεύσασθαι θέλοντες, καὶ γίνεται περὶ τῆς ὑδρείας αὐτοῖς ἅμιλλα. ἐκεῖθεν δὲ διὰ τῆς Εὐβοίας καὶ τῆς Λοκρίδος πλεύσαντες εἰς Ἰωλκὸν ἦλθον, τὸν πάντα πλοῦν ἐν τέτταρσι μησὶ τελειώσαντες.

[26] Sailing by night they encountered a violent storm, and Apollo, taking his stand on the Melantian ridges, flashed lightning down, shooting a shaft into the sea. Then they perceived an island close at hand, and anchoring there they named it Anaphe, because it had loomed up （anaphanenai） unexpectedly. So they founded an altar of Radiant Apollo, and having offered sacrifice they betook them to feasting; and twelve handmaids, whom Arete had given to Medea, jested merrily with the chiefs; whence it is still customary for the women to jest at the sacrifice.Putting to sea from there, they were hindered from touching at Crete by Talos. Some say that he was a man of the Brazen Race, others that he was given to Minos by Hephaestus; he was a brazen man, but some say that he was a bull. He had a single vein extending from his neck to his ankles, and a bronze nail was rammed home at the end of the vein. This Talos kept guard, running round the island thrice every day; wherefore, when he saw the Argo standing inshore, he pelted it as usual with stones. His death was brought about by the wiles of Medea, whether, as some say, she drove him mad by drugs, or, as others say, she promised to make him immortal and then drew out the nail, so that all the ichor gushed out and he died. But some say that Poeas shot him dead in the ankle.After tarrying a single night there they put in to Aegina to draw water, and a contest arose among them concerning the drawing of the water. Thence they sailed betwixt Euboea and Locris and came to Iolcus, having completed the whole voyage in four months.

[27] Πελίας δὲ ἀπογνοὺς τὴν ὑποστροφὴν τῶν Ἀργοναυτῶν τὸν Αἴσονα κτείνειν ἤθελεν: ὁ δὲ αἰτησάμενος ἑαυτὸν ἀνελεῖν θυσίαν ἐπιτελῶν ἀδεῶς τοῦ ταυρείου σπασάμενος αἵματος ἀπέθανεν. ἡ δὲ Ἰάσονος μήτηρ ἐπαρασαμένη Πελίᾳ, νήπιον ἀπολιποῦσα παῖδα Πρόμαχον ἑαυτὴν ἀνήρτησε: Πελίας δὲ καὶ τὸν αὐτῇ καταλειφθέντα παῖδα ἀπέκτεινεν. ὁ δὲ Ἰάσων κατελθὼν τὸ μὲν δέρας ἔδωκε, περὶ ὧν δὲ ἠδικήθη μετελθεῖν ἐθέλων καιρὸν ἐξεδέχετο. καὶ τότε μὲν εἰς Ἰσθμὸν μετὰ τῶν ἀριστέων πλεύσας ἀνέθηκε τὴν ναῦν Ποσειδῶνι, αὖθις δὲ Μήδειαν παρακαλεῖ ζητεῖν ὅπως Πελίας αὐτῷ δίκας ὑπόσχῃ. ἡ δὲ εἰς τὰ βασίλεια τοῦ Πελίου παρελθοῦσα πείθει τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτοῦ τὸν πατέρα κρεουργῆσαι καὶ καθεψῆσαι, διὰ φαρμάκων αὐτὸν ἐπαγγελλομένη ποιήσειν νέον: καὶ τοῦ πιστεῦσαι χάριν κριὸν μελίσασα καὶ καθεψήσασα ἐποίησεν ἄρνα. αἱ δὲ πιστεύσασαι τὸν πατέρα κρεουργοῦσι καὶ καθέψουσιν. Ἄκαστος δὲ μετὰ τῶν τὴν Ἰωλκὸν οἰκούντων τὸν πατέρα θάπτει, τὸν δὲ Ἰάσονα μετὰ τῆς Μηδείας τῆς Ἰωλκοῦ ἐκβάλλει.

[27] Now Pelias, despairing of the return of the Argonauts, would have killed Aeson; but he requested to be allowed to take his own life, and in offering a sacrifice drank freely of the bull’s blood and died. And Jason’s mother cursed Pelias and hanged herself, leaving behind an infant son Promachus; but Pelias slew even the son whom she had left behind. On his return Jason surrendered the fleece, but though he longed to avenge his wrongs he bided his time. At that time he sailed with the chiefs to the Isthmus and dedicated the ship to Poseidon, but afterwards he exhorted Medea to devise how he could punish Pelias. So she repaired to the palace of Pelias and persuaded his daughters to make mince meat of their father and boil him, promising to make him young again by her drugs; and to win their confidence she cut up a ram and made it into a lamb by boiling it. So they believed her, made mince meat of their father and boiled him. But Acastus buried his father with the help of the inhabitants of Iolcus, and he expelled Jason and Medea from Iolcus.

[28] οἱ δὲ ἧκον εἰς Κόρινθον, καὶ δέκα μὲν ἔτη διετέλουν εὐτυχοῦντες, αὖθις δὲ τοῦ τῆς Κορίνθου βασιλέως Κρέοντος τὴν θυγατέρα Γλαύκην Ἰάσονι ἐγγυῶντος, παραπεμψάμενος Ἰάσων Μήδειαν ἐγάμει. ἡ δέ, οὕς τε ὤμοσεν Ἰάσων θεοὺς ἐπικαλεσαμένη καὶ τὴν Ἰάσονος ἀχαριστίαν μεμψαμένη πολλάκις, τῇ μὲν γαμουμένῃ πέπλον μεμαγμένον φαρμάκοις ἔπεμψεν, ὃν ἀμφιεσαμένη μετὰ τοῦ βοηθοῦντος πατρὸς πυρὶ λάβρῳ κατεφλέχθη, τοὺς δὲ παῖδας οὓς εἶχεν ἐξ Ἰάσονος, Μέρμερον καὶ Φέρητα, ἀπέκτεινε, καὶ λαβοῦσα παρὰ Ἡλίου ἅρμα πτηνῶν δρακόντων ἐπὶ τούτου φεύγουσα ἦλθεν εἰς Ἀθήνας. λέγεται δὲ καὶ ὅτι φεύγουσα τοὺς παῖδας ἔτι νηπίους ὄντας κατέλιπεν, ἱκέτας καθίσασα ἐπὶ τὸν βωμὸν τῆς Ἥρας τῆς ἀκραίας: Κορίνθιοι δὲ αὐτοὺς ἀναστήσαντες κατετραυμάτισαν.Μήδεια δὲ ἧκεν εἰς Ἀθήνας, κἀκεῖ γαμηθεῖσα Αἰγεῖ παῖδα γεννᾷ Μῆδον. ἐπιβουλεύουσα δὲ ὕστερον Θησεῖ φυγὰς ἐξ Ἀθηνῶν μετὰ τοῦ παιδὸς ἐκβάλλεται. ἀλλ᾽ οὗτος μὲν πολλῶν κρατήσας βαρβάρων τὴν ὑφ᾽ ἑαυτὸν χώραν ἅπασαν Μηδίαν ἐκάλεσε, καὶ στρατευόμενος ἐπὶ Ἰνδοὺς ἀπέθανε: Μήδεια δὲ εἰς Κόλχους ἦλθεν ἄγνωστος, καὶ καταλαβοῦσα Αἰήτην ὑπὸ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ Πέρσου τῆς βασιλείας ἐστερημένον, κτείνασα τοῦτον τῷ πατρὶ τὴν βασιλείαν ἀποκατέστησεν.

[28] They went to Corinth, and lived there happily for ten years, till Creon, king of Corinth, betrothed his daughter Glauce to Jason, who married her and divorced Medea. But she invoked the gods by whom Jason had sworn, and after often upbraiding him with his ingratitude she sent the bride a robe steeped in poison, which when Glauce had put on, she was consumed with fierce fire along with her father, who went to her rescue. But Mermerus and Pheres, the children whom Medea had by Jason, she killed, and having got from the Sun a car drawn by winged dragons she fled on it to Athens. Another tradition is that on her flight she left behind her children, who were still infants, setting them as suppliants on the altar of Hera of the Height; but the Corinthians removed them and wounded them to death.Medea came to Athens, and being there married to Aegeus bore him a son Medus. Afterwards, however, plotting against Theseus, she was driven a fugitive from Athens with her son. But he conquered many barbarians and called the whole country under him Media, and marching against the Indians he met his death. And Medea came unknown to Colchis, and finding that Aeetes had been deposed by his brother Perses, she killed Perses and restored the kingdom to her father.
