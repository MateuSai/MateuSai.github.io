### CHAPTER VIII

[1] Οἰνεὺς δὲ βασιλεύων Καλυδῶνος παρὰ Διονύσου φυτὸν ἀμπέλου πρῶτος ἔλαβε. γήμας δὲ Ἀλθαίαν τὴν Θεστίου γεννᾷ Τοξέα, ὃν αὐτὸς ἔκτεινεν ὑπερπηδήσαντα τὴν τάφρον, καὶ παρὰ τοῦτον Θυρέα καὶ Κλύμενον, καὶ θυγατέρα Γόργην, ἣν Ἀνδραίμων ἔγημε, καὶ Δηιάνειραν, ἣν Ἀλθαίαν λέγουσιν ἐκ Διονύσου γεννῆσαι. αὕτη δ᾽ ἡνιόχει καὶ τὰ κατὰ πόλεμον ἤσκει, καὶ περὶ τῶν γάμων αὐτῆς Ἡρακλῆς πρὸς Ἀχελῷον ἐπάλαισεν.

[1] Reigning over Calydon, Oeneus was the first who received a vine-plant from Dionysus. He married Althaea, daughter of Thestius, and begat Toxeus, whom he slew with his own hand because he leaped over the ditch. And besides Toxeus he had Thyreus and Clymenus, and a daughter Gorge, whom Andraemon married, and another daughter Deianira, who is said to have been begotten on Althaea by Dionysus. This Deianira drove a chariot and practised the art of war, and Hercules wrestled for her hand with Achelous.

[2] ἐγέννησε δὲ Ἀλθαία παῖδα ἐξ Οἰνέως Μελέαγρον, ὃν ἐξ Ἄρεος γεγεννῆσθαί φασι. τούτου δ᾽ ὄντος ἡμερῶν ἑπτὰ παραγενομένας τὰς μοίρας φασὶν εἰπεῖν, ὅτι τότε τελευτήσει Μελέαγρος, ὅταν ὁ καιόμενος ἐπὶ τῆς ἐσχάρας δαλὸς κατακαῇ. τοῦτο ἀκούσασα τὸν δαλὸν ἀνείλετο Ἀλθαία καὶ κατέθετο εἰς λάρνακα. Μελέαγρος δὲ ἀνὴρ ἄτρωτος καὶ γενναῖος γενόμενος τόνδε τὸν τρόπον ἐτελεύτησεν. ἐτησίων καρπῶν ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ γενομένων τὰς ἀπαρχὰς Οἰνεὺς θεοῖς πᾶσι θύων μόνης Ἀρτέμιδος ἐξελάθετο. ἡ δὲ μηνίσασα κάπρον ἐφῆκεν ἔξοχον μεγέθει τε καὶ ῥώμῃ, ὃς τήν τε γῆν ἄσπορον ἐτίθει καὶ τὰ βοσκήματα καὶ τοὺς ἐντυγχάνοντας διέφθειρεν. ἐπὶ τοῦτον τὸν κάπρον τοὺς ἀρίστους ἐκ τῆς Ἑλλάδος πάντας συνεκάλεσε, καὶ τῷ κτείναντι τὸν θῆρα τὴν δορὰν δώσειν ἀριστεῖον ἐπηγγείλατο. οἱ δὲ συνελθόντες ἐπὶ τὴν τοῦ κάπρου θήραν ἦσαν οἵδε: Μελέαγρος Οἰνέως, Δρύας Ἄρεος, ἐκ Καλυδῶνος οὗτοι, Ἴδας καὶ Λυγκεὺς Ἀφαρέως ἐκ Μεσσήνης, Κάστωρ καὶ Πολυδεύκης Διὸς καὶ Λήδας ἐκ Λακεδαίμονος, Θησεὺς Αἰγέως ἐξ Ἀθηνῶν, Ἄδμητος Φέρητος ἐκ Φερῶν, Ἀγκαῖος καὶ Κηφεὺς Λυκούργου ἐξ Ἀρκαδίας, Ἰάσων Αἴσονος ἐξ Ἰωλκοῦ, Ἰφικλῆς Ἀμφιτρύωνος ἐκ Θηβῶν, Πειρίθους Ἰξίονος ἐκ Λαρίσης, Πηλεὺς Αἰακοῦ ἐκ Φθίας, Τελαμὼν Αἰακοῦ ἐκ Σαλαμῖνος, Εὐρυτίων Ἄκτορος ἐκ Φθίας, Ἀταλάντη Σχοινέως ἐξ Ἀρκαδίας, Ἀμφιάραος Ὀικλέους ἐξ Ἄργους: μετὰ τούτων καὶ οἱ Θεστίου παῖδες. συνελθόντας δὲ αὐτοὺς Οἰνεὺς ἐπὶ ἐννέα ἡμέρας ἐξένισε: τῇ δεκάτῃ δὲ Κηφέως καὶ Ἀγκαίου καί τινων ἄλλων ἀπαξιούντων μετὰ γυναικὸς ἐπὶ τὴν θήραν ἐξιέναι, Μελέαγρος ἔχων γυναῖκα Κλεοπάτραν τὴν Ἴδα καὶ Μαρπήσσης θυγατέρα, βουλόμενος δὲ καὶ ἐξ Ἀταλάντης τεκνοποιήσασθαι, συνηνάγκασεν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὴν θήραν μετὰ ταύτης ἐξιέναι. περιστάντων δὲ αὐτῶν τὸν κάπρον, Ὑλεὺς μὲν καὶ Ἀγκαῖος ὑπὸ τοῦ θηρὸς διεφθάρησαν, Εὐρυτίωνα δὲ Πηλεὺς ἄκων κατηκόντισε. τὸν δὲ κάπρον πρώτη μὲν Ἀταλάντη εἰς τὰ νῶτα ἐτόξευσε, δεύτερος δὲ Ἀμφιάραος εἰς τὸν ὀφθαλμόν: Μελέαγρος δὲ αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν κενεῶνα πλήξας ἀπέκτεινε, καὶ λαβὼν τὸ δέρας ἔδωκεν Ἀταλάντῃ. οἱ δὲ Θεστίου παῖδες, ἀδοξοῦντες εἰ παρόντων ἀνδρῶν γυνὴ τὰ ἀριστεῖα λήψεται, τὸ δέρας αὐτῆς ἀφείλοντο, κατὰ γένος αὑτοῖς προσήκειν λέγοντες, εἰ Μελέαγρος λαμβάνειν μὴ προαιροῖτο.

[2] Althaea had also a son Meleager, by Oeneus, though they say that he was begotten by Ares. It is said that, when he was seven days old, the Fates came and declared that Meleager should die when the brand burning on the hearth was burnt out. On hearing that, Althaea snatched up the brand and deposited it in a chest. Meleager grew up to be an invulnerable and gallant man, but came by his end in the following way. In sacrificing the first fruits of the annual crops of the country to all the gods Oeneus forgot Artemis alone. But she in her wrath sent a boar of extraordinary size and strength, which prevented the land from being sown and destroyed the cattle and the people that fell in with it. To attack this boar Oeneus called together all the noblest men of Greece, and promised that to him who should kill the beast he would give the skin as a prize. Now the men who assembled to hunt the boar were these: — Meleager, son of Oeneus; Dryas, son of Ares; these came from Calydon; Idas and Lynceus, sons of Aphareus, from Messene; Castor and Pollux, sons of Zeus and Leda, from Lacedaemon; Theseus, son of Aegeus, from Athens; Admetus, son of Pheres, from Pherae; Ancaeus and Cepheus, sons of Lycurgus, from Arcadia; Jason, son of Aeson, from Iolcus; Iphicles, son of Amphitryon, from Thebes; Pirithous, son of Ixion, from Larissa; Peleus, son of Aeacus, from Phthia; Telamon, son of Aeacus, from Salamis; Eurytion, son of Actor, from Phthia; Atalanta, daughter of Schoeneus, from Arcadia; Amphiaraus, son of Oicles, from Argos. With them came also the sons of Thestius. And when they were assembled, Oeneus entertained them for nine days; but on the tenth, when Cepheus and Ancaeus and some others disdained to go hunting with a woman, Meleager compelled them to follow the chase with her, for he desired to have a child also by Atalanta, though he had to wife Cleopatra, daughter of Idas and Marpessa. When they surrounded the boar, Hyleus and Ancaeus were killed by the brute, and Peleus struck down Eurytion undesignedly with a javelin. But Atalanta was the first to shoot the boar in the back with an arrow, and Amphiaraus was the next to shoot it in the eye; but Meleager killed it by a stab in the flank, and on receiving the skin gave it to Atalanta. Nevertheless the sons of Thestius, thinking scorn that a woman should get the prize in the face of men, took the skin from her, alleging that it belonged to them by right of birth if Meleager did not choose to take it.

[3] ὀργισθεὶς δὲ Μελέαγρος τοὺς μὲν Θεστίου παῖδας ἀπέκτεινε, τὸ δὲ δέρας ἔδωκε τῇ Ἀταλάντῃ. Ἀλθαία δὲ λυπηθεῖσα ἐπὶ τῇ τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἀπωλείᾳ τὸν δαλὸν ἧψε, καὶ ὁ Μελέαγρος ἐξαίφνης ἀπέθανεν.οἱ δέ φασιν οὐχ οὕτω Μελέαγρον τελευτῆσαι, ἀμφισβητούντων δὲ τῆς δορᾶς τῶν Θεστίου παίδων ὡς Ἰφίκλου πρώτου βαλόντος, Κούρησι καὶ Καλυδωνίοις πόλεμον ἐνστῆναι, ἐξελθόντος δὲ Μελεάγρου καί τινας τῶν Θεστίου παίδων φονεύσαντος Ἀλθαίαν ἀράσασθαι κατ᾽ αὐτοῦ: τὸν δὲ ὀργιζόμενον οἴκοι μένειν. ἤδη δὲ τῶν πολεμίων τοῖς τείχεσι προσπελαζόντων καὶ τῶν πολιτῶν ἀξιούντων μεθ᾽ ἱκετηρίας βοηθεῖν, μόλις πεισθέντα ὑπὸ τῆς γυναικὸς ἐξελθεῖν, καὶ τοὺς λοιποὺς κτείναντα τῶν Θεστίου παίδων ἀποθανεῖν μαχόμενον. μετὰ δὲ τὸν Μελεάγρου θάνατον Ἀλθαία καὶ Κλεοπάτρα ἑαυτὰς ἀνήρτησαν, αἱ δὲ θρηνοῦσαι τὸν νεκρὸν γυναῖκες ἀπωρνεώθησαν.

[3] But Meleager in a rage slew the sons of Thestius and gave the skin to Atalanta. However, from grief at the slaughter of her brothers Althaea kindled the brand, and Meleager immediately expired.But some say that Meleager did not die in that way, but that when the sons of Thestius claimed the skin on the ground that Iphiclus had been the first to hit the boar, war broke out between the Curetes and the Calydonians; and when Meleager had sallied out and slain some of the sons of Thestius, Althaea cursed him, and he in a rage remained at home; however, when the enemy approached the walls, and the citizens supplicated him to come to the rescue, he yielded reluctantly to his wife and sallied forth, and having killed the rest of the sons of Thestius, he himself fell fighting. After the death of Meleager, Althaea and Cleopatra hanged themselves, and the women who mourned the dead man were turned into birds.

[4] Ἀλθαίας δὲ ἀποθανούσης ἔγημεν Οἰνεὺς Περίβοιαν τὴν Ἱππονόου. ταύτην δὲ ὁ μὲν γράψας τὴν Θηβαΐδα πολεμηθείσης Ὠλένου λέγει λαβεῖν Οἰνέα γέρας, Ἡσίοδος δὲ ἐξ Ὠλένου τῆς Ἀχαΐας, ἐφθαρμένην ὑπὸ Ἱπποστράτου τοῦ Ἀμαρυγκέως, Ἱππόνουν τὸν πατέρα πέμψαι πρὸς Οἰνέα πόρρω τῆς Ἑλλάδος ὄντα, ἐντειλάμενον ἀποκτεῖναι.

[4] After Althaea’s death Oeneus married Periboea, daughter of Hipponous. The author of the Thebaid says that when Olenus was sacked, Oeneus received Periboea as a gift of honor; but Hesiod says that she was seduced by Hippostratus, son of Amarynceus, and that her father Hipponous sent her away from Olenus in Achaia to Oeneus, because he dwelt far from Greece, with an injunction to put her to death.

[5] εἰσὶ δὲ οἱ λέγοντες Ἱππόνουν ἐπιγνόντα τὴν ἰδίαν θυγατέρα ἐφθαρμένην ὑπὸ Οἰνέως, ἔγκυον αὐτὴν πρὸς τοῦτον ἀποπέμψαι. ἐγεννήθη δὲ ἐκ ταύτης Οἰνεῖ Τυδεύς. Πείσανδρος δὲ αὐτὸν ἐκ Γόργης γενέσθαι λέγει: τῆς γὰρ θυγατρὸς Οἰνέα κατὰ τὴν βούλησιν Διὸς ἐρασθῆναι.Τυδεὺς δὲ ἀνὴρ γενόμενος γενναῖος ἐφυγαδεύθη, κτείνας, ὡς μέν τινες λέγουσιν, ἀδελφὸν Οἰνέως Ἀλκάθοον, ὡς δὲ ὁ τὴν Ἀλκμαιωνίδα γεγραφώς, τοὺς Μέλανος παῖδας ἐπιβουλεύοντας Οἰνεῖ, Φηνέα Εὐρύαλον Ὑπέρλαον Ἀντίοχον Εὐμήδην Στέρνοπα Ξάνθιππον Σθενέλαον, ὡς δὲ Φερεκύδης φησίν, Ὠλενίαν ἀδελφὸν ἴδιον. Ἀγρίου δὲ δίκας ἐπάγοντος αὐτῷ φυγὼν εἰς Ἄργος ἧκε πρὸς Ἄδραστον, καὶ τὴν τούτου γήμας θυγατέρα Δηιπύλην ἐγέννησε Διομήδην.Τυδεὺς μὲν οὖν ἐπὶ Θήβας μετ᾽ Ἀδράστου στρατευσάμενος ὑπὸ Μελανίππου τρωθεὶς ἀπέθανεν:

[5] However, some say that Hipponous discovered that his daughter had been debauched by Oeneus, and therefore he sent her away to him when she was with child. By her Oeneus begat Tydeus. But Pisander says that the mother of Tydeus was Gorge, for Zeus willed it that Oeneus should fall in love with his own daughter.When Tydeus had grown to be a gallant man he was banished for killing, as some say, Alcathous, brother of Oeneus; but according to the author of the Alcmaeonidhis victims were the sons of Melas who had plotted against Oeneus, their names being Pheneus, Euryalus, Hyperlaus, Antiochus, Eumedes, Sternops, Xanthippus, Sthenelaus; but as Pherecydes will have it, he murdered his own brother Olenias. Being arraigned by Agrius, he fled to Argos and came to Adrastus, whose daughter Deipyle he married and begat Diomedes.Tydeus marched against Thebes with Adrastus, and died of a wound which he received at the hand of Melanippus.

[6] οἱ δὲ Ἀγρίου παῖδες, Θερσίτης Ὀγχηστὸς Πρόθοος Κελεύτωρ Λυκωπεὺς Μελάνιππος, ἀφελόμενοι τὴν Οἰνέως βασιλείαν τῷ πατρὶ ἔδοσαν, καὶ προσέτι ζῶντα τὸν Οἰνέα καθείρξαντες ᾐκίζοντο. ὕστερον δὲ Διομήδης ἐξ Ἄργους παραγενόμενος μετ᾽ Ἀλκμαίωνος κρύφα τοὺς μὲν Ἀγρίου παῖδας, χωρὶς Ὀγχηστοῦ καὶ Θερσίτου, πάντας ἀπέκτεινεν （οὗτοι γὰρ φθάσαντες εἰς Πελοπόννησον ἔφυγον）, τὴν δὲ βασιλείαν, ἐπειδὴ γηραιὸς ἦν ὁ Οἰνεύς, Ἀνδραίμονι τῷ τὴν θυγατέρα τοῦ Οἰνέως γήμαντι δέδωκε, τὸν δὲ Οἰνέα εἰς Πελοπόννησον ἦγεν. οἱ δὲ διαφυγόντες Ἀγρίου παῖδες ἐνεδρεύσαντες περὶ τὴν Τηλέφου ἑστίαν τῆς Ἀρκαδίας τὸν πρεσβύτην ἀπέκτειναν. Διομήδης δὲ τὸν νεκρὸν εἰς Ἄργος κομίσας ἔθαψεν ἔνθα νῦν πόλις ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνου Οἰνόη καλεῖται, καὶ γήμας Αἰγιάλειαν τὴν Ἀδράστου, ἢ ὡς ἔνιοι φασι τὴν Αἰγιαλέως, ἐπί τε Θήβας καὶ Τροίαν ἐστράτευσε.

[6] But the sons of Agrius, to wit, Thersites, Onchestus, Prothous, Celeutor, Lycopeus, Melanippus, wrested the kingdom from Oeneus and gave it to their father, and more than that they imprisoned Oeneus in his lifetime and tormented him. Nevertheless Diomedes afterwards came secretly with Alcmaeon from Argos and put to death all the sons of Agrius, except Onchestus and Thersites, who had fled betimes to Peloponnese; and as Oeneus was old, Diomedes gave the kingdom to Andraemon who had married the daughter of Oeneus, but Oeneus himself he took with him to Peloponnese. Howbeit, the sons of Agrius, who had made their escape, lay in wait for the old man at the hearth of Telephus in Arcadia, and killed him. But Diomedes conveyed the corpse to Argos and buried him in the place where now a city is called Oenoe after him. And having married Aegialia, daughter of Adrastus or, as some say, of Aegialeus, he went to the wars against Thebes and Troy.
