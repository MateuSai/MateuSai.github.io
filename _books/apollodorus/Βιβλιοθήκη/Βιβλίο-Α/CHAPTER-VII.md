### CHAPTER VII

[1] Προμηθεὺς δὲ ἐξ ὕδατος καὶ γῆς ἀνθρώπους πλάσας ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς καὶ πῦρ, λάθρᾳ Διὸς ἐν νάρθηκι κρύψας. ὡς δὲ ᾔσθετο Ζεύς, ἐπέταξεν Ἡφαίστῳ τῷ Καυκάσῳ ὄρει τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ προσηλῶσαι: τοῦτο δὲ Σκυθικὸν ὄρος ἐστίν. ἐν δὴ τούτῳ προσηλωθεὶς Προμηθεὺς πολλῶν ἐτῶν ἀριθμὸν ἐδέδετο: καθ᾽ ἑκάστην δὲ ἡμέραν ἀετὸς ἐφιπτάμενος αὐτῷ τοὺς λοβοὺς ἐνέμετο τοῦ ἥπατος αὐξανομένου διὰ νυκτός. καὶ Προμηθεὺς μὲν πυρὸς κλαπέντος δίκην ἔτινε ταύτην, μέχρις Ἡρακλῆς αὐτὸν ὕστερον ἔλυσεν, ὡς ἐν τοῖς καθ᾽ Ἡρακλέα δηλώσομεν.

[1] Prometheus moulded men out of water and earth and gave them also fire, which, unknown to Zeus, he had hidden in a stalk of fennel. But when Zeus learned of it, he ordered Hephaestus to nail his body to Mount Caucasus, which is a Scythian mountain. On it Prometheus was nailed and kept bound for many years. Every day an eagle swooped on him and devoured the lobes of his liver, which grew by night. That was the penalty that Prometheus paid for the theft of fire until Hercules afterwards released him, as we shall show in dealing with Hercules.

[2] Προμηθέως δὲ παῖς Δευκαλίων ἐγένετο. οὗτος βασιλεύων τῶν περὶ τὴν Φθίαν τόπων γαμεῖ Πύρραν τὴν Ἐπιμηθέως καὶ Πανδώρας, ἣν ἔπλασαν θεοὶ πρώτην γυναῖκα. ἐπεὶ δὲ ἀφανίσαι Ζεὺς τὸ χαλκοῦν ἠθέλησε γένος, ὑποθεμένου Προμηθέως Δευκαλίων τεκτηνάμενος λάρνακα, καὶ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἐνθέμενος, εἰς ταύτην μετὰ Πύρρας εἰσέβη. Ζεὺς δὲ πολὺν ὑετὸν ἀπ᾽ οὐρανοῦ χέας τὰ πλεῖστα μέρη τῆς Ἑλλάδος κατέκλυσεν, ὥστε διαφθαρῆναι πάντας ἀνθρώπους, ὀλίγων χωρὶς οἳ συνέφυγον εἰς τὰ πλησίον ὑψηλὰ ὄρη. τότε δὲ καὶ τὰ κατὰ Θεσσαλίαν ὄρη διέστη, καὶ τὰ ἐκτὸς Ἰσθμοῦ καὶ Πελοποννήσου συνεχέθη πάντα. Δευκαλίων δὲ ἐν τῇ λάρνακι διὰ τῆς θαλάσσης φερόμενος ἐφ᾽ ἡμέρας ἐννέα καὶ νύκτας τὰς ἴσας τῷ Παρνασῷ προσίσχει, κἀκεῖ τῶν ὄμβρων παῦλαν λαβόντων ἐκβὰς θύει Διὶ φυξίῳ. Ζεὺς δὲ πέμψας Ἑρμῆν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐπέτρεψεν αἱρεῖσθαι ὅ τι βούλεται: ὁ δὲ αἱρεῖται ἀνθρώπους αὐτῷ γενέσθαι. καὶ Διὸς εἰπόντος ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς ἔβαλλεν αἴρων λίθους, καὶ οὓς μὲν ἔβαλε Δευκαλίων, ἄνδρες ἐγένοντο, οὓς δὲ Πύρρα, γυναῖκες. ὅθεν καὶ λαοὶ μεταφορικῶς ὠνομάσθησαν ἀπὸ τοῦ λᾶας ὁ λίθος.γίνονται δὲ ἐκ Πύρρας Δευκαλίωνι παῖδες Ἕλλην μὲν πρῶτος, ὃν ἐκ Διὸς γεγεννῆσθαι ἔνιοι λέγουσι, δεύτερος δὲ Ἀμφικτύων ὁ μετὰ Κραναὸν βασιλεύσας τῆς Ἀττικῆς, θυγάτηρ δὲ Πρωτογένεια, ἐξ ἧς καὶ Διὸς Ἀέθλιος.

[2] And Prometheus had a son Deucalion. He reigning in the regions about Phthia, married Pyrrha, the daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora, the first woman fashioned by the gods. And when Zeus would destroy the men of the Bronze Age, Deucalion by the advice of Prometheus constructed a chest, and having stored it with provisions he embarked in it with Pyrrha. But Zeus by pouring heavy rain from heaven flooded the greater part of Greece, so that all men were destroyed, except a few who fled to the high mountains in the neighborhood. It was then that the mountains in Thessaly parted, and that all the world outside the Isthmus and Peloponnese was overwhelmed. But Deucalion, floating in the chest over the sea for nine days and as many nights, drifted to Parnassus, and there, when the rain ceased, he landed and sacrificed to Zeus, the god of Escape. And Zeus sent Hermes to him and allowed him to choose what he would, and he chose to get men. And at the bidding of Zeus he took up stones and threw them over his head, and the stones which Deucalion threw became men, and the stones which Pyrrha threw became women. Hence people were called metaphorically people （ laos） from laas, “ a stone. “ And Deucalion had children by Pyrrha, first Hellen, whose father some say was Zeus, and second Amphictyon, who reigned over Attica after Cranaus; and third a daughter Protogenia, who became the mother of Aethlius by Zeus.

[3] Ἕλληνος δὲ καὶ νύμφης Ὀρσηίδος Δῶρος Ξοῦθος Αἴολος. αὐτὸς μὲν οὖν ἀφ᾽ αὑτοῦ τοὺς καλουμένους Γραικοὺς προσηγόρευσεν Ἕλληνας, τοῖς δὲ παισὶν ἐμέρισε τὴν χώραν: καὶ Ξοῦθος μὲν λαβὼν τὴν Πελοπόννησον ἐκ Κρεούσης τῆς Ἐρεχθέως Ἀχαιὸν ἐγέννησε καὶ Ἴωνα, ἀφ᾽ ὧν Ἀχαιοὶ καὶ Ἴωνες καλοῦνται, Δῶρος δὲ τὴν πέραν χώραν Πελοποννήσου λαβὼν τοὺς κατοίκους ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ Δωριεῖς ἐκάλεσεν, Αἴολος δὲ βασιλεύων τῶν περὶ τὴν Θεσσαλίαν τόπων τοὺς ἐνοικοῦντας Αἰολεῖς προσηγόρευσε, καὶ γήμας Ἐναρέτην τὴν Δηιμάχου παῖδας μὲν ἐγέννησεν ἑπτά, Κρηθέα Σίσυφον Ἀθάμαντα Σαλμωνέα Δηιόνα Μάγνητα Περιήρην, θυγατέρας δὲ πέντε, Κανάκην Ἀλκυόνην Πεισιδίκην Καλύκην Περιμήδην.Περιμήδης μὲν οὖν καὶ Ἀχελῴου Ἱπποδάμας καὶ Ὀρέστης, Πεισιδίκης δὲ καὶ Μυρμιδόνος Ἄντιφος καὶ Ἄκτωρ.

[3] Hellen had Dorus, Xuthus, and Aeolus by a nymph Orseis. Those who were called Greeks he named Hellenes after himself, and divided the country among his sons. Xuthus received Peloponnese and begat Achaeus and Ion by Creusa, daughter of Erechtheus, and from Achaeus and Ion the Achaeans and Ionians derive their names. Dorus received the country over against Peloponnese and called the settlers Dorians after himself. Aeolus reigned over the regions about Thessaly and named the inhabitants Aeolians. He married Enarete, daughter of Deimachus, and begat seven sons, Cretheus, Sisyphus, Athamas, Salmoneus, Deion, Magnes, Perieres, and five daughters, Canace, Alcyone, Pisidice, Calyce, Perimede.Perimede had Hippodamas and Orestes by Achelous; and Pisidice had Antiphus and Actor by Myrmidon.

[4] Ἀλκυόνην δὲ Κῆυξ ἔγημεν Ἑωσφόρου παῖς. οὗτοι δὲ δι᾽ ὑπερηφάνειαν ἀπώλοντο: ὁ μὲν γὰρ τὴν γυναῖκα ἔλεγεν Ἥραν, ἡ δὲ τὸν ἄνδρα Δία, Ζεὺς δὲ αὐτοὺς ἀπωρνέωσε, καὶ τὴν μὲν ἀλκυόνα ἐποίησε τὸν δὲ κήυκα.Κανάκη δὲ ἐγέννησεν ἐκ Ποσειδῶνος Ὁπλέα καὶ Νιρέα καὶ Ἐπωπέα καὶ Ἀλωέα καὶ Τρίοπα. Ἀλωεὺς μὲν οὖν ἔγημεν Ἰφιμέδειαν τὴν Τρίοπος, ἥτις Ποσειδῶνος ἠράσθη, καὶ συνεχῶς φοιτῶσα ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν, χερσὶν ἀρυομένη τὰ κύματα τοῖς κόλποις ἐνεφόρει. συνελθὼν δὲ αὐτῇ Ποσειδῶν δύο ἐγέννησε παῖδας, Ὦτον καὶ Ἐφιάλτην, τοὺς Ἀλωάδας λεγομένους. οὗτοι κατ᾽ ἐνιαυτὸν ηὔξανον πλάτος μὲν πηχυαῖον μῆκος δὲ ὀργυιαῖον: ἐννέα δὲ ἐτῶν γενόμενοι, καὶ τὸ μὲν πλάτος πηχῶν ἔχοντες ἐννέα τὸ δὲ μέγεθος ὀργυιῶν ἐννέα, πρὸς θεοὺς μάχεσθαι διενοοῦντο, καὶ τὴν μὲν Ὄσσαν ἐπὶ τὸν Ὄλυμπον ἔθεσαν, ἐπὶ δὲ τὴν Ὄσσαν θέντες τὸ Πήλιον διὰ τῶν ὀρῶν τούτων ἠπείλουν εἰς οὐρανὸν ἀναβήσεσθαι, καὶ τὴν μὲν θάλασσαν χώσαντες τοῖς ὄρεσι ποιήσειν ἔλεγον ἤπειρον, τὴν δὲ γῆν θάλασσαν, ἐμνῶντο δὲ Ἐφιάλτης μὲν Ἥραν Ὦτος δὲ Ἄρτεμιν. ἔδησαν δὲ καὶ Ἄρην. τοῦτον μὲν οὖν Ἑρμῆς ἐξέκλεψεν, ἀνεῖλε δὲ τοὺς Ἀλωάδας ἐν Νάξῳ Ἄρτεμις δι᾽ ἀπάτης: ἀλλάξασα γὰρ τὴν ἰδέαν εἰς ἔλαφον διὰ μέσων αὐτῶν ἐπήδησεν, οἱ δὲ βουλόμενοι εὐστοχῆσαι τοῦ θηρίου ἐφ᾽ ἑαυτοὺς ἠκόντισαν.

[4] Alcyone was married by Ceyx, son of Lucifer. These perished by reason of their pride; for he said that his wife was Hera, and she said that her husband was Zeus. But Zeus turned them into birds; her he made a kingfisher （ alcyon） and him a gannet （ ceyx）.Canace had by Poseidon Hopleus and Nireus and Epopeus and Aloeus and Triops. Aloeus wedded Iphimedia, daughter of Triops; but she fell in love with Poseidon, and often going to the sea she would draw up the waves with her hands and pour them into her lap. Poseidon met her and begat two sons, Otus and Ephialtes, who are called the Aloads. These grew every year a cubit in breadth and a fathom in height; and when they were nine years old, being nine cubits broad and nine fathoms high, they resolved to fight against the gods, and they set Ossa on Olympus, and having set Pelion on Ossa they threatened by means of these mountains to ascend up to heaven, and they said that by filling up the sea with the mountains they would make it dry land, and the land they would make sea. And Ephialtes wooed Hera, and Otus wooed Artemis; moreover they put Ares in bonds. However, Hermes rescued Ares by stealth, and Artemis killed the Aloads in Naxos by a ruse. For she changed herself into a deer and leaped between them, and in their eagerness to hit the quarry they threw their darts at each other.

[5] Καλύκης δὲ καὶ Ἀεθλίου παῖς Ἐνδυμίων γίνεται, ὅστις ἐκ Θεσσαλίας Αἰολέας ἀγαγὼν Ἦλιν ᾤκισε. λέγουσι δὲ αὐτόν τινες ἐκ Διὸς γενέσθαι. τούτου κάλλει διενεγκόντος ἠράσθη Σελήνη, Ζεὺς δὲ αὐτῷ δίδωσιν ὃ βούλεται ἑλέσθαι: ὁ δὲ αἱρεῖται κοιμᾶσθαι διὰ παντὸς ἀθάνατος καὶ ἀγήρως μένων.

[5] Calyce and Aethlius had a son Endymion who led Aeolians from Thessaly and founded Elis. But some say that he was a son of Zeus. As he was of surpassing beauty, the Moon fell in love with him, and Zeus allowed him to choose what he would, and he chose to sleep for ever, remaining deathless and ageless.

[6] Ἐνδυμίωνος δὲ καὶ νηίδος νύμφης, ἢ ὥς τινες Ἰφιανάσσης, Αἰτωλός, ὃς ἀποκτείνας Ἆπιν τὸν Φορωνέως καὶ φυγὼν εἰς τὴν Κουρήτιδα χώραν, κτείνας τοὺς ὑποδεξαμένους Φθίας καὶ Ἀπόλλωνος υἱούς, Δῶρον καὶ Λαόδοκον καὶ Πολυποίτην, ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ τὴν χώραν Αἰτωλίαν ἐκάλεσεν.

[6] Endymion had by a Naiad nymph or, as some say, by Iphianassa, a son Aetolus, who slew Apis, son of Phoroneus, and fled to the Curetian country. There he killed his hosts, Dorus and Laodocus and Polypoetes, the sons of Phthia and Apollo, and called the country Aetolia after himself.

[7] Αἰτωλοῦ δὲ καὶ Προνόης τῆς Φόρβου Πλευρὼν καὶ Καλυδὼν ἐγένοντο, ἀφ᾽ ὧν αἱ ἐν Αἰτωλίᾳ πόλεις ὠνομάσθησαν. Πλευρὼν μὲν οὖν γήμας Ξανθίππην τὴν Δώρου παῖδα ἐγέννησεν Ἀγήνορα, θυγατέρας δὲ Στερόπην καὶ Στρατονίκην καὶ Λαοφόντην: Καλυδῶνος δὲ καὶ Αἰολίας τῆς Ἀμυθάονος Ἐπικάστη καὶ Πρωτογένεια, ἐξ ἧς καὶ Ἄρεος Ὄξυλος. Ἀγήνωρ δὲ ὁ Πλευρῶνος γήμας Ἐπικάστην τὴν Καλυδῶνος ἐγέννησε Πορθάονα καὶ Δημονίκην, ἧς καὶ Ἄρεος Εὔηνος Μῶλος Πύλος Θέστιος.

[7] Aetolus and Pronoe, daughter of Phorbus, had sons, Pleuron and Calydon, after whom the cities in Aetolia were named. Pleuron wedded Xanthippe, daughter of Dorus, and begat a son Agenor, and daughters, Sterope and Stratonice and Laophonte. Calydon and Aeolia, daughter of Amythaon, had daughters, Epicaste and Protogenia, who had Oxylus by Ares. And Agenor, son of Pleuron, married Epicaste, daughter of Calydon, and begat Porthaon and Demonice, who had Evenus, Molus, Pylus, and Thestius by Ares.

[8] Εὔηνος μὲν οὖν ἐγέννησε Μάρπησσαν, ἣν Ἀπόλλωνος μνηστευομένου Ἴδας ὁ Ἀφαρέως ἥρπασε, λαβὼν παρὰ Ποσειδῶνος ἅρμα ὑπόπτερον. διώκων δὲ Εὔηνος ἐφ᾽ ἅρματος ἐπὶ τὸν Λυκόρμαν ἦλθε ποταμόν, καταλαβεῖν δ᾽ οὐ δυνάμενος τοὺς μὲν ἵππους ἀπέσφαξεν, ἑαυτὸν δ᾽ εἰς τὸν ποταμὸν ἔβαλε: καὶ καλεῖται Εὔηνος ὁ ποταμὸς ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνου.

[8] Evenus begat Marpessa, who was wooed by Apollo, but Idas, son of Aphareus, carried her off in a winged chariot which he received from Poseidon. Pursuing him in a chariot, Evenus came to the river Lycormas, but when he could not catch him he slaughtered his horses and threw himself into the river, and the river is called Evenus after him.

[9] Ἴδας δὲ εἰς Μεσσήνην παραγίνεται, καὶ αὐτῷ ὁ Ἀπόλλων περιτυχὼν ἀφαιρεῖται τὴν κόρην. μαχομένων δὲ αὐτῶν περὶ τῶν τῆς παιδὸς γάμων, Ζεὺς διαλύσας ἐπέτρεψεν αὐτῇ τῇ παρθένῳ ἑλέσθαι ὁποτέρῳ βούλεται συνοικεῖν: ἡ δὲ δείσασα, ὡς ἂν μὴ γηρῶσαν αὐτὴν Ἀπόλλων καταλίπῃ, τὸν Ἴδαν εἵλετο ἄνδρα.

[9] But Idas came to Messene, and Apollo, falling in with him, would have robbed him of the damsel. As they fought for the girl’s hand, Zeus parted them and allowed the maiden herself to choose which of the two she would marry; and she, because she feared that Apollo might desert her in her old age, chose Idas for her husband.

[10] Θεστίῳ δὲ ἐξ Εὐρυθέμιδος τῆς Κλεοβοίας ἐγένοντο θυγατέρες μὲν Ἀλθαία Λήδα Ὑπερμνήστρα, ἄρρενες δὲ Ἴφικλος Εὔιππος Πλήξιππος Εὐρύπυλος.Πορθάονος δὲ καὶ Εὐρύτης τῆς Ἱπποδάμαντος ἐγένοντο παῖδες Οἰνεὺς Ἄγριος Ἀλκάθοος Μέλας Λευκωπεύς, θυγάτηρ δὲ Στερόπη, ἐξ ἧς καὶ Ἀχελῴου Σειρῆνας γενέσθαι λέγουσιν.

[10] Thestius had daughters and sons by Eurythemis, daughter of Cleoboea: the daughters were Althaea, Leda, Hypermnestra, and the males were Iphiclus, Evippus, Plexippus, and Eurypylus.Porthaon and Euryte, daughter of Hippodamas, had sons, Oeneus, Agrius, Alcathous, Melas, Leucopeus, and a daughter Sterope, who is said to have been the mother of the Sirens by Achelous.
