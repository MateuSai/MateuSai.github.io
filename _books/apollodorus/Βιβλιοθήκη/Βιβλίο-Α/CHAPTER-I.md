### CHAPTER I

[1] Οὐρανὸς πρῶτος τοῦ παντὸς ἐδυνάστευσε κόσμου. γήμας δὲ Γῆν ἐτέκνωσε πρώτους τοὺς ἑκατόγχειρας προσαγορευθέντας, Βριάρεων Γύην Κόττον, οἳ μεγέθει τε ἀνυπέρβλητοι καὶ δυνάμει καθειστήκεσαν, χεῖρας μὲν ἀνὰ ἑκατὸν κεφαλὰς δὲ ἀνὰ πεντήκοντα ἔχοντες.

[1] Sky was the first who ruled over the whole world. And having wedded Earth, he begat first the Hundred-handed, as they are named: Briareus, Gyes, Cottus, who were unsurpassed in size and might, each of them having a hundred hands and fifty heads.

[2] μετὰ τούτους δὲ αὐτῷ τεκνοῖ Γῆ Κύκλωπας, Ἄργην Στερόπην Βρόντην, ὧν ἕκαστος εἶχεν ἕνα ὀφθαλμὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ μετώπου. ἀλλὰ τούτους μὲν Οὐρανὸς δήσας εἰς Τάρταρον ἔρριψε （τόπος δὲ οὗτος ἐρεβώδης ἐστὶν ἐν Ἅιδου, τοσοῦτον ἀπὸ γῆς ἔχων διάστημα ὅσον ἀπ᾽ οὐρανοῦ γῆ）,

[2] After these, Earth bore him the Cyclopes, to wit, Arges, Steropes, Brontes, of whom each had one eye on his forehead. But them Sky bound and cast into Tartarus, a gloomy place in Hades as far distant from earth as earth is distant from the sky.

[3] τεκνοῖ δὲ αὖθις ἐκ Γῆς παῖδας μὲν τοὺς Τιτᾶνας προσαγορευθέντας, Ὠκεανὸν Κοῖον Ὑπερίονα Κρεῖον Ἰαπετὸν καὶ νεώτατον ἁπάντων Κρόνον, θυγατέρας δὲ τὰς κληθείσας Τιτανίδας, Τηθὺν Ῥέαν Θέμιν Μνημοσύνην Φοίβην Διώνην Θείαν.

[3] And again he begat children by Earth, to wit, the Titans as they are named: Ocean, Coeus, Hyperion, Crius, Iapetus, and, youngest of all, Cronus; also daughters, the Titanides as they are called: Tethys, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Dione, Thia.

[4] ἀγανακτοῦσα δὲ Γῆ ἐπὶ τῇ ἀπωλείᾳ τῶν εἰς Τάρταρον ῥιφέντων παίδων πείθει τοὺς Τιτᾶνας ἐπιθέσθαι τῷ πατρί, καὶ δίδωσιν ἀδαμαντίνην ἅρπην Κρόνῳ. οἱ δὲ Ὠκεανοῦ χωρὶς ἐπιτίθενται, καὶ Κρόνος ἀποτεμὼν τὰ αἰδοῖα τοῦ πατρὸς εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν ἀφίησεν. ἐκ δὲ τῶν σταλαγμῶν τοῦ ῥέοντος αἵματος ἐρινύες ἐγένοντο, Ἀληκτὼ Τισιφόνη Μέγαιρα. τῆς δὲ ἀρχῆς ἐκβαλόντες τούς τε καταταρταρωθέντας ἀνήγαγον ἀδελφοὺς καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν Κρόνῳ παρέδοσαν.

[4] But Earth, grieved at the destruction of her children, who had been cast into Tartarus, persuaded the Titans to attack their father and gave Cronus an adamantine sickle. And they, all but Ocean, attacked him, and Cronus cut off his father’s genitals and threw them into the sea; and from the drops of the flowing blood were born Furies, to wit, Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera. And, having dethroned their father, they brought up their brethren who had been hurled down to Tartarus, and committed the sovereignty to Cronus.

[5] ὁ δὲ τούτους μὲν ἐν τῷ Ταρτάρῳ πάλιν δήσας καθεῖρξε, τὴν δὲ ἀδελφὴν Ῥέαν γήμας, ἐπειδὴ Γῆ τε καὶ Οὐρανὸς ἐθεσπιῴδουν αὐτῷ λέγοντες ὑπὸ παιδὸς ἰδίου τὴν ἀρχὴν ἀφαιρεθήσεσθαι, κατέπινε τὰ γεννώμενα. καὶ πρώτην μὲν γεννηθεῖσαν Ἑστίαν κατέπιεν, εἶτα Δήμητραν καὶ Ἥραν, μεθ᾽ ἃς Πλούτωνα καὶ Ποσειδῶνα.

[5] But he again bound and shut them up in Tartarus, and wedded his sister Rhea; and since both Earth and Sky foretold him that he would be dethroned by his own son, he used to swallow his offspring at birth. His firstborn Hestia he swallowed, then Demeter and Hera, and after them Pluto and Poseidon.

[6] ὀργισθεῖσα δὲ ἐπὶ τούτοις Ῥέα παραγίνεται μὲν εἰς Κρήτην, ὁπηνίκα τὸν Δία ἐγκυμονοῦσα ἐτύγχανε, γεννᾷ δὲ ἐν ἄντρῳ τῆς Δίκτης Δία. καὶ τοῦτον μὲν δίδωσι τρέφεσθαι Κούρησί τε καὶ ταῖς Μελισσέως παισὶ νύμφαις, Ἀδραστείᾳ τε καὶ Ἴδῃ.

[6] Enraged at this, Rhea repaired to Crete, when she was big with Zeus, and brought him forth in a cave of Dicte. She gave him to the Curetes and to the nymphs Adrastia and Ida, daughters of Melisseus, to nurse.

[7] αὗται μὲν οὖν τὸν παῖδα ἔτρεφον τῷ τῆς Ἀμαλθείας γάλακτι, οἱ δὲ Κούρητες ἔνοπλοι ἐν τῷ ἄντρῳ τὸ βρέφος φυλάσσοντες τοῖς δόρασι τὰς ἀσπίδας συνέκρουον, ἵνα μὴ τῆς τοῦ παιδὸς φωνῆς ὁ Κρόνος ἀκούσῃ. Ῥέα δὲ λίθον σπαργανώσασα δέδωκε Κρόνῳ καταπιεῖν ὡς τὸν γεγεννημένον παῖδα.

[7] So these nymphs fed the child on the milk of Amalthea; and the Curetes in arms guarded the babe in the cave, clashing their spears on their shields in order that Cronus might not hear the child’s voice. But Rhea wrapped a stone in swaddling clothes and gave it to Cronus to swallow, as if it were the newborn child.
