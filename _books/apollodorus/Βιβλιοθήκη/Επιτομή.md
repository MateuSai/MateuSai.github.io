## Επιτομή

[1] τρίτην ἔκτεινεν ἐν Κρομμυῶνι σῦν τὴν καλουμένην Φαιὰν ἀπὸ τῆς θρεψάσης γραὸς αὐτήν: ταύτην τινὲς Ἐχίδνης καὶ Τυφῶνος λέγουσι.

[1] Third, he slew at Crommyon the sow that was called Phaea after the old woman who bred it; that sow, some say, was the offspring of Echidna and Typhon.

[2] τέταρτον ἔκτεινε Σκείρωνα τὸν Κορίνθιον τοῦ Πέλοπος, ὡς δὲ ἔνιοι Ποσειδῶνος. οὗτος ἐν τῇ Μεγαρικῇ κατέχων τὰς ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ κληθείσας πέτρας Σκειρωνίδας, ἠνάγκαζε τοὺς παριόντας νίζειν αὐτοῦ τοὺς πόδας, καὶ νίζοντας εἰς τὸν βυθὸν αὐτοὺς ἔρριπτε βορὰν ὑπερμεγέθει χελώνῃ.

[2] Fourth, he slew Sciron, the Corinthian, son of Pelops, or, as some say, of Poseidon. He in the Megarian territory held the rocks called after him Scironian, and compelled passers-by to wash his feet, and in the act of washing he kicked them into the deep to be the prey of a huge turtle.

[3] Θησεὺς δὲ ἁρπάσας αὐτὸν τῶν ποδῶν ἔρριψεν εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν. πέμπτον ἔκτεινεν ἐν Ἐλευσῖνι Κερκυόνα τὸν Βράγχου καὶ Ἀργιόπης νύμφης. οὗτος ἠνάγκαζε τοὺς παριόντας παλαίειν καὶ παλαίων ἀνῄρει: Θησεὺς δὲ αὐτὸν μετέωρον ἀράμενος ἔρραξεν εἰς γῆν.

[3] But Theseus seized him by the feet and threw him into the sea. Fifth, in Eleusis he slew Cercyon, son of Branchus and a nymph Argiope. This Cercyon compelled passers-by to wrestle, and in wrestling killed them. But Theseus lifted him up on high and dashed him to the ground.

[4] ἕκτον ἀπέκτεινε Δαμάστην, ὃν ἔνιοι Πολυπήμονα λέγουσιν. οὗτος τὴν οἴκησιν ἔχων παρ᾽ ὁδὸν ἐστόρεσε δύο κλίνας, μίαν μὲν μικράν, ἑτέραν δὲ μεγάλην, καὶ τοὺς παριόντας ἐπὶ ξένια καλῶν τοὺς μὲν βραχεῖς ἐπὶ τῆς μεγάλης κατακλίνων σφύραις ἔτυπτεν, ἵν᾽ ἐξισωθῶσι τῇ κλίνῃ, τοὺς δὲ μεγάλους ἐπὶ τῆς μικρᾶς, καὶ τὰ ὑπερέχοντα τοῦ σώματος ἀπέπριζε.καθάρας οὖν Θησεὺς τὴν ὁδὸν ἧκεν εἰς Ἀθήνας.

[4] Sixth, he slew Damastes, whom some call Polypemon. He had his dwelling beside the road, and made up two beds, one small and the other big; and offering hospitality to the passers-by, he laid the short men on the big bed and hammered them, to make them fit the bed; but the tall men he laid on the little bed and sawed off the portions of the body that projected beyond it.So, having cleared the road, Theseus came to Athens.

[5] Μήδεια δὲ Αἰγεῖ τότε συνοικοῦσα ἐπεβούλευσεν αὐτῷ, καὶ πείθει τὸν Αἰγέα φυλάττεσθαι ὡς ἐπίβουλον αὐτῷ. Αἰγεὺς δὲ τὸν ἴδιον ἀγνοῶν παῖδα, δείσας ἔπεμψεν ἐπὶ τὸν Μαραθώνιον ταῦρον.

[5] But Medea, being then wedded to Aegeus, plotted against him and persuaded Aegeus to beware of him as a traitor. And Aegeus, not knowing his own son, was afraid and sent him against the Marathonian bull.

[6] ὡς δὲ ἀνεῖλεν αὐτόν, παρὰ Μηδείας λαβὼν αὐθήμερον προσήνεγκεν αὐτῷ φάρμακον. ὁ δὲ μέλλοντος αὐτῷ τοῦ ποτοῦ προσφέρεσθαι ἐδωρήσατο τῷ πατρὶ τὸ ξίφος, ὅπερ ἐπιγνοὺς Αἰγεὺς τὴν κύλικα ἐξέρριψε τῶν χειρῶν αὐτοῦ. Θησεὺς δὲ ἀναγνωρισθεὶς τῷ πατρὶ καὶ τὴν ἐπιβουλὴν μαθὼν ἐξέβαλε τὴν Μήδειαν.

[6] And when Theseus had killed it, Aegeus presented to him a poison which he had received the selfsame day from Medea. But just as the draught was about to be administered to him, he gave his father the sword, and on recognizing it Aegeus dashed the cup from his hands. And when Theseus was thus made known to his father and informed of the plot, he expelled Medea.

[7] καὶ εἰς τὸν τρίτον δασμὸν τῷ Μινωταύρῳ συγκαταλέγεταιὡς δέ τινες λέγουσιν, ἑκὼν ἑαυτὸν ἔδωκεν. ἐχούσης δὲ τῆς νεὼς μέλαν ἱστίον Αἰγεὺς τῷ παιδὶ ἐνετείλατο, ἐὰν ὑποστρέφῃ ζῶν, λευκοῖς πετάσαι τὴν ναῦν ἱστίοις.

[7] And he was numbered among those who were to be sent as the third tribute to the Minotaur; or, as some affirm, he offered himself voluntarily. And as the ship had a black sail, Aegeus charged his son, if he returned alive, to spread white sails on the ship.

[8] ὡς δὲ ἧκεν εἰς Κρήτην, Ἀριάδνη θυγάτηρ Μίνωος ἐρωτικῶς διατεθεῖσα πρὸς αὐτὸν συμπράσσειν ἐπαγγέλλεται,ἐὰν ὁμολογήσῃ γυναῖκα αὐτὴν ἕξειν ἀπαγαγὼν εἰς Ἀθήνας. ὁμολογήσαντος δὲ σὺν ὅρκοις Θησέως δεῖται Δαιδάλου μηνῦσαι τοῦ λαβυρίνθου τὴν ἔξοδον.

[8] And when he came to Crete, Ariadne, daughter of Minos, being amorously disposed to him, offered to help him if he would agree to carry her away to Athens and have her to wife. Theseus having agreed on oath to do so, she besought Daedalus to disclose the way out of the labyrinth.

[9] ὑποθεμένου δὲ ἐκείνου, λίνον εἰσιόντι Θησεῖ δίδωσι: τοῦτο ἐξάψας Θησεὺς τῆς θύρας ἐφελκόμενος εἰσῄει. καταλαβὼν δὲ Μινώταυρον ἐν ἐσχάτῳ μέρει τοῦ λαβυρίνθου παίων πυγμαῖς ἀπέκτεινεν, ἐφελκόμενος δὲ τὸ λίνον πάλιν ἐξῄει. καὶ διὰ νυκτὸς μετὰ Ἀριάδνης καὶ τῶν παίδων εἰς Νάξον ἀφικνεῖται. ἔνθα Διόνυσος ἐρασθεὶς Ἀριάδνης ἥρπασε, καὶ κομίσας εἰς Λῆμνον ἐμίγη.καὶ γεννᾷ Θόαντα Στάφυλον Οἰνοπίωνα καὶ Πεπάρηθον.

[9] And at his suggestion she gave Theseus a clue when he went in; Theseus fastened it to the door, and, drawing it after him, entered in. And having found the Minotaur in the last part of the labyrinth, he killed him by smiting him with his fists; and drawing the clue after him made his way out again. And by night he arrived with Ariadne and the children at Naxos. There Dionysus fell in love with Ariadne and carried her off; and having brought her to Lemnos he enjoyed her, and begat Thoas, Staphylus, Oenopion, and Peparethus.

[10] λυπούμενος δὲ Θησεὺς ἐπ᾽ Ἀριάδνῃ καταπλέων ἐπελάθετο πετάσαι τὴν ναῦν λευκοῖς ἱστίοις. Αἰγεὺς δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς ἀκροπόλεως τὴν ναῦν ἰδὼν ἔχουσαν μέλαν ἱστίον, Θησέα νομίσας ἀπολλέναι ῥίψας ἑαυτὸν μετήλλαξε.

[10] In his grief on account of Ariadne, Theseus forgot to spread white sails on his ship when he stood for port; and Aegeus, seeing from the acropolis the ship with a black sail, supposed that Theseus had perished; so he cast himself down and died.

[11] Θησεὺς δὲ παρέλαβε τὴν Ἀθηναίων δυναστείαν, καὶτοὺς μὲν Πάλλαντος παῖδας πεντήκοντα τὸν ἀριθμὸν ἀπέκτεινεν: ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ ὅσοι ἀντᾶραι ἤθελον παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἀπεκτάνθησαν, καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν ἅπασαν ἔσχε μόνος.

[11] But Theseus succeeded to the sovereignty of Athens, and killed the sons of Pallas, fifty in number; likewise all who would oppose him were killed by him, and he got the whole government to himself.

[12] ὅτι Μίνως, αἰσθόμενος τοῦ φεύγειν τοὺς μετὰ Θησέως, Δαίδαλον αἴτιον ἐν τῷ λαβυρίνθῳ μετὰ τοῦ παιδὸς Ἰκάρου καθεῖρξεν, ὃς ἐγεγέννητο αὐτῷ ἐκ δούλης Μίνωος Ναυκράτης. ὁ δὲ πτερὰ κατασκευάσας ἑαυτῷ καὶ τῷ παιδὶ ἀναπτάντι ἐνετείλατο μήτε εἰς ὕψος πέτεσθαι, μὴ τακείσης τῆς κόλλης ὑπὸ τοῦ ἡλίου αἱ πτέρυγες λυθῶσι, μήτε ἐγγὺς θαλάσσης, ἵνα μὴ τὰ πτερὰ ὑπὸ τῆς νοτίδος λυθῇ.

[12] On being apprized of the flight of Theseus and his company, Minos shut up the guilty Daedalus in the labyrinth, along with his son Icarus, who had been borne to Daedalus by Naucrate, a female slave of Minos. But Daedalus constructed wings for himself and his son, and enjoined his son, when he took to flight, neither to fly high, lest the glue should melt in the sun and the wings should drop off, nor to fly near the sea, lest the pinions should be detached by the damp.

[13] Ἴκαρος δὲ ἀμελήσας τῶν τοῦ πατρὸς ἐντολῶν ψυχαγωγούμενος ἀεὶ μετέωρος ἐφέρετο: τακείσης δὲ τῆς κόλλης πεσὼν εἰς τὴν ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνου κληθεῖσαν Ἰκαρίαν θάλασσαν ἀπέθανε. Δαίδαλος δὲ διασώζεται εἰς Κάμικον τῆς Σικελίας.

[13] But the infatuated Icarus, disregarding his father’s injunctions, soared ever higher, till, the glue melting, he fell into the sea called after him Icarian, and perished. But Daedalus made his way safely to Camicus in Sicily.

[14] Δαίδαλον δὲ ἐδίωκε Μίνως, καὶ καθ᾽ ἑκάστην χώραν ἐρευνῶν ἐκόμιζε κόχλον, καὶ πολὺν ἐπηγγέλλετο δώσειν μισθὸν τῷ διὰ τοῦ κοχλίου λίνον διείραντι, διὰ τούτου νομίζων εὑρήσειν Δαίδαλον. ἐλθὼν δὲ εἰς Κάμικον τῆς Σικελίας παρὰ Κώκαλον, παρ᾽ ᾧ Δαίδαλος ἐκρύπτετο, δείκνυσι τὸν κοχλίαν. ὁ δὲ λαβὼν ἐπηγγέλλετο διείρειν καὶ Δαιδάλῳ δίδωσιν:

[14] And Minos pursued Daedalus, and in every country that he searched he carried a spiral shell and promised to give a great reward to him who should pass a thread through the shell, believing that by that means he should discover Daedalus. And having come to Camicus in Sicily, to the court of Cocalus, with whom Daedalus was concealed, he showed the spiral shell. Cocalus took it, and promised to thread it, and gave it to Daedalus;

[15] ὁ δὲ ἐξάψας μύρμηκος λίνον καὶ τρήσας τὸν κοχλίαν εἴασε δι᾽ αὐτοῦ διελθεῖν. λαβὼν δὲ Μίνως τὸ λίνον διειρμένον ᾔσθετο ὄντα παρ᾽ ἐκείνῳ Δαίδαλον, καὶ εὐθέως ἀπῄτει. Κώκαλος δὲ ὑποσχόμενος ἐκδώσειν ἐξένισεν αὐτόν: ὁ δὲ λουσάμενος ὑπὸ τῶν Κωκάλου θυγατέρων ἔκλυτος ἐγένετο: ὡς δὲ ἔνιοί φασι, ζεστῷ καταχυθεὶς ὕδατι μετήλλαξεν.

[15] and Daedalus fastened a thread to an ant, and, having bored a hole in the spiral shell, allowed the ant to pass through it. But when Minos found the thread passed through the shell, he perceived that Daedalus was with Cocalus, and at once demanded his surrender. Cocalus promised to surrender him, and made an entertainment for Minos; but after his bath Minos was undone by the daughters of Cocalus; some say, however, that he died through being drenched with boiling water.

[16] συστρατευσάμενος δὲ ἐπὶ Ἀμαζόνας Ἡρακλεῖ ἥρπασενἈντιόπην, ὡς δέ τινες Μελανίππην, Σιμωνίδης δὲ Ἱππολύτην. διὸ ἐστράτευσαν ἐπ᾽ Ἀθήνας Ἀμαζόνες. καὶ στρατοπεδευσαμένας αὐτὰς περὶ τὸν Ἄρειον πάγον Θησεὺς μετὰ Ἀθηναίων ἐνίκησεν.ἔχων δὲ ἐκ τῆς Ἀμαζόνος παῖδα Ἱππόλυτον,

[16] Theseus joined Hercules in his expedition against the Amazons and carried off Antiope, or, as some say, Melanippe; but Simonides calls her Hippolyte. Wherefore the Amazons marched against Athens, and having taken up a position about the Areopagus they were vanquished by the Athenians under Theseus. And though he had a son Hippolytus by the Amazon,

[17] λαμβάνει μετὰ ταῦτα παρὰ Δευκαλίωνος Φαίδραν τὴν Μίνωος θυγατέρα,ἧς ἐπιτελουμένων τῶν γάμων Ἀμαζὼν ἡ προγαμηθεῖσα Θησεῖ τοὺς συγκατακειμένους σὺν ταῖς μεθ᾽ ἑαυτῆς Ἀμαζόσιν ἐπιστᾶσα σὺν ὅπλοις κτείνειν ἔμελλεν. οἱ δὲ κλείσαντες διὰ τάχους τὰς θύρας ἀπέκτειναν αὐτὴν. τινὲς δὲ μαχομένην αὐτὴν ὑπὸ Θησέως λέγουσιν ἀποθανεῖν.

[17] Theseus afterwards received from Deucalion in marriage Phaedra, daughter of Minos; and when her marriage was being celebrated, the Amazon that had before been married to him appeared in arms with her Amazons, and threatened to kill the assembled guests. But they hastily closed the doors and killed her. However, some say that she was slain in battle by Theseus.

[18] Φαίδρα δὲ γεννήσασα Θησεῖ δύο παιδία Ἀκάμαντα καὶ Δημοφῶντα ἐρᾷ τοῦ ἐκ τῆς Ἀμαζόνος παιδὸς ἤγουν τοῦ Ἱππολύτου καὶ δεῖται συνελθεῖν αὐτῇ. ὁ δὲ μισῶν πάσας γυναῖκας τὴν συνουσίαν ἔφυγεν. ἡ δὲ Φαίδρα, δείσασα μὴ τῷ πατρὶ διαβάλῃ, κατασχίσασα τὰς τοῦ θαλάμου θύρας καὶ τὰς ἐσθῆτας σπαράξασα κατεψεύσατο Ἱππολύτου βίαν.

[18] And Phaedra, after she had borne two children, Acamas and Demophon, to Theseus, fell in love with the son he had by the Amazon, to wit, Hippolytus, and besought him to lie with her. Howbeit, he fled from her embraces, because he hated all women. But Phaedra, fearing that he might accuse her to his father, cleft open the doors of her bed-chamber, rent her garments, and falsely charged Hippolytus with an assault.

[19] Θησεὺς δὲ πιστεύσας ηὔξατο Ποσειδῶνι Ἱππόλυτον διαφθαρῆναι: ὁ δέ, θέοντος αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τοῦ ἅρματος καὶ παρὰ τῇ θαλάσσῃ ὀχουμένου, ταῦρον ἀνῆκεν ἐκ τοῦ κλύδωνος. πτοηθέντων δὲ τῶν ἵππων κατηρράχθη τὸ ἅρμα. ἐμπλακεὶς δὲ ταῖς ἡνίαις Ἱππόλυτος συρόμενος ἀπέθανε. γενομένου δὲ τοῦ ἔρωτος περιφανοῦς ἑαυτὴν ἀνήρτησε Φαίδρα.

[19] Theseus believed her and prayed to Poseidon that Hippolytus might perish. So, when Hippolytus was riding in his chariot and driving beside the sea, Poseidon sent up a bull from the surf, and the horses were frightened, the chariot dashed in pieces, and Hippolytus, entangled in the reins, was dragged to death. And when her passion was made public, Phaedra hanged herself.

[20] ὅτι ὁ Ἰξίων Ἥρας ἐρασθεὶς ἐπεχείρει βιάζεσθαι, καὶ προσαγγειλάσης τῆς Ἥρας γνῶναι θέλων ὁ Ζεύς, εἰ οὕτως ἔχει τὸ πρᾶγμα, νεφέλην ἐξεικάσας Ἥρᾳ παρέκλινεν αὐτῷ: καὶ καυχώμενον ὡς Ἥρᾳ μιγέντα ἐνέδησε τροχῷ, ὑφ᾽ οὗ φερόμενος διὰ πνευμάτων ἐν αἰθέρι ταύτην τίνει δίκην. νεφέλη δὲ ἐξ Ἰξίονος ἐγέννησε Κένταυρον.

[20] Ixion fell in love with Hera and attempted to force her; and when Hera reported it, Zeus, wishing to know if the thing were so, made a cloud in the likeness of Hera and laid it beside him; and when Ixion boasted that he had enjoyed the favours of Hera, Zeus bound him to a wheel, on which he is whirled by winds through the air; such is the penalty he pays. And the cloud, impregnated by Ixion, gave birth to Centaurus.

[21] συνεμάχησε δὲ τῷ Πειρίθῳ Θησεύς, ὅτε κατὰ τῶν Κενταύρων συνεστήσατο πόλεμον. Πειρίθους γὰρ Ἱπποδάμειαν μνηστευόμενος εἱστία Κενταύρους ὡς συγγενεῖς ὄντας αὐτῇ. ἀσυνήθως δὲ ἔχοντες οἴνου ἀφειδῶς ἐμφορησάμενοι ἐμέθυον, καὶ εἰσαγομένην τὴν νύμφην ἐπεχείρουν βιάζεσθαι: ὁ δὲ Πειρίθους μετὰ Θησέως καθοπλισάμενος μάχην συνῆψε, καὶ πολλοὺς ὁ Θησεὺς αὐτῶν ἀνεῖλεν.

[21] “ And Theseus allied himself with Pirithous, when he engaged in war against the centaurs. For when Pirithous wooed Hippodamia, he feasted the centaurs because they were her kinsmen. But being unaccustomed to wine, they made themselves drunk by swilling it greedily, and when the bride was brought in, they attempted to violate her. But Pirithous, fully armed, with Theseus, joined battle with them, and Theseus killed many of them.”Zenobius, Cent. v.33.

[22] ὅτι Καινεὺς πρότερον ἦν γυνή, συνελθόντος δὲ αὐτῇ Ποσειδῶνος ᾐτήσατο ἀνὴρ γενέσθαι ἄτρωτος: διὸ καὶ ἐν τῇ πρὸς Κενταύρους μάχῃ τραυμάτων καταφρονῶν πολλοὺς τῶν Κενταύρων ἀπώλεσεν, οἱ δὲ λοιποί, περιστάντες αὐτῷ, ἐλάταις τύπτοντες ἔχωσαν εἰς γῆν.

[22] Caeneus was formerly a woman, but after that Poseidon had intercourse with her, she asked to become an invulnerable man; wherefore in the battle with the centaurs he thought scorn of wounds and killed many of the centaurs; but the rest of them surrounded him and by striking him with fir trees buried him in the earth.

[23] ὅτι Θησεύς, Πειρίθῳ συνθέμενος Διὸς θυγατέρας γαμῆσαι, ἑαυτῷ μὲν ἐκ Σπάρτης μετ᾽ ἐκείνου ἥρπασεν Ἑλένην δωδεκαέτη οὖσαν, Πειρίθῳ δὲ μνηστευόμενος τὸν Περσεφόνης γάμον εἰς Ἅιδου κάτεισι. καὶ Διόσκουροι μὲν μετὰ Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ Ἀρκάδων εἷλον Ἀθήνας καὶ ἀπάγουσιν Ἑλένην καὶ μετὰ ταύτης Αἴθραν τὴν Πιτθέως αἰχμάλωτον: Δημοφῶν δὲ καὶ Ἀκάμας ἔφυγον. κατάγουσι δὲ καὶ Μενεσθέα καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν τῶν Ἀθηναίων διδόασι τούτῳ.

[23] Having made a compact with Pirithous that they would marry daughters of Zeus, Theseus, with the help of Pirithous, carried off Helen from Sparta for himself, when she was twelve years old, and in the endeavor to win Persephone as a bride for Pirithous he went down to Hades. And the Dioscuri, with the Lacedaemonians and Arcadians, captured Athens and carried away Helen, and with her Aethra, daughter of Pittheus, into captivity; but Demophon and Acamas fled. And the Dioscuri also brought back Menestheus from exile, and gave him the sovereignty of Athens.

[24] Θησεὺς δὲ μετὰ Πειρίθου παραγενόμενος εἰς Ἅιδου ἐξαπατᾶται, καὶ ὃς ὡς ξενίων μεταληψομένους πρῶτον ἐν τῷ τῆς Λήθης εἶπε καθεσθῆναι θρόνῳ, ᾧ προσφυέντες σπείραις δρακόντων κατείχοντο. Πειρίθους μὲν οὖν εἰς ἀίδιον δεθεὶς ἔμεινε, Θησέα δὲ Ἡρακλῆς ἀναγαγὼν ἔπεμψεν εἰς Ἀθήνας. ἐκεῖθεν δὲ ὑπὸ Μενεσθέως ἐξελαθεὶς πρὸς Λυκομήδην ἦλθεν, ὃς αὐτὸν βάλλει κατὰ βαράθρων καὶ ἀποκτείνει.

[24] But when Theseus arrived with Pirithous in Hades, he was beguiled; for, on the pretence that they were about to partake of good cheer, Hades bade them first be seated on the Chair of Forgetfulness, to which they grew and were held fast by coils of serpents. Pirithous, therefore, remained bound for ever, but Hercules brought Theseus up and sent him to Athens. Thence he was driven by Menestheus and went to Lycomedes, who threw him down an abyss and killed him.

[1] ὅτι ὁ Τάνταλος ἐν Ἅιδου κολάζεται, πέτρον ἔχων ὕπερθεν ἑαυτοῦ ἐπιφερόμενον, ἐν λίμνῃ τε διατελῶν καὶ περὶ τοὺς ὤμους ἑκατέρωσε δένδρα μετὰ καρπῶν ὁρῶν παρὰ τῇ λίμνῃ πεφυκότα: τὸ μὲν οὖν ὕδωρ ψαύει αὐτοῦ τῶν γενύων, καὶ ὅτε θέλοι σπάσασθαι τούτου ξηραίνεται, τῶν δὲ καρπῶν ὁπότε βούλοιτο μεταλήψεσθαι μετεωρίζονται μέχρι νεφῶν ὑπ᾽ ἀνέμων τὰ δένδρα σὺν τοῖς καρποῖς. κολάζεσθαι δὲ αὐτὸν οὕτως λέγουσί τινες, ὅτι τὰ τῶν θεῶν ἐξελάλησεν ἀνθρώποις μυστήρια, καὶ ὅτι τῆς ἀμβροσίας τοῖς ἡλικιώταις μετεδίδου.

[1] Tantalus is punished in Hades by having a stone impending over him, by being perpetually in a lake and seeing at his shoulders on either side trees with fruit growing beside the lake. The water touches his jaws, but when he would take a draught of it, the water dries up; and when he would partake of the fruits, the trees with the fruits are lifted by winds as high as the clouds. Some say that he is thus punished because he blabbed to men the mysteries of the gods, and because he attempted to share ambrosia with his fellows.

[2] ὅτι Βροτέας κυνηγὸς ὢν τὴν Ἄρτεμιν οὐκ ἐτίμα: ἔλεγε δέ, ὡς οὐδ᾽ ἂν ὑπὸ πυρός τι πάθοι: ἐμμανὴς οὖν γενόμενος ἔβαλεν εἰς πῦρ ἑαυτόν.

[2] Broteas, a hunter, did not honor Artemis, and said that even fire could not hurt him. So he went mad and threw himself into fire.

[3] ὅτι Πέλοψ σφαγεὶς ἐν τῷ τῶν θεῶν ἐράνῳ καὶ καθεψηθεὶς ὡραιότερος ἐν τῇ ἀναζωώσει γέγονε, καὶ κάλλει διενεγκὼν Ποσειδῶνος ἐρώμενος γίνεται, ὃς αὐτῷ δίδωσιν ἅρμα ὑπόπτερον: τοῦτο καὶ διὰ θαλάσσης τρέχον τοὺς ἄξονας οὐχ ὑγραίνετο.

[3] Pelops, after being slaughtered and boiled at the banquet of the gods, was fairer than ever when he came to life again, and on account of his surpassing beauty he became a minion of Poseidon, who gave him a winged chariot, such that even when it ran through the sea the axles were not wet.

[4] τοῦ δὲ βασιλεύοντος Πίσης Οἰνομάου θυγατέρα ἔχοντος Ἱπποδάμειαν, καὶ εἴτε αὐτῆς ἐρῶντος, ὥς τινες λέγουσιν, εἴτε χρησμὸν ἔχοντος τελευτῆσαι ὑπὸ τοῦ γήμαντος αὐτήν, οὐδεὶς αὐτὴν ἐλάμβανεν εἰς γυναῖκα: ὁ μὲν γὰρ πατὴρ οὐκ ἔπειθεν αὑτῷ συνελθεῖν, οἱ δὲ μνηστευόμενοι ἀνῃροῦντο ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ.

[4] Now Oenomaus, the king of Pisa, had a daughter Hippodamia, and whether it was that he loved her, as some say, or that he was warned by an oracle that he must die by the man that married her, no man got her to wife; for her father could not persuade her to cohabit with him, and her suitors were put by him to death.

[5] ἔχων γὰρ ὅπλα τε καὶ ἵππους παρὰ Ἄρεος ἆθλον ἐτίθει τοῖς μνηστῆρσι τὸν γάμον, καὶ τὸν μνηστευόμενον ἔδει ἀναλαβόντα τὴν Ἱπποδάμειαν εἰς τὸ οἰκεῖον ἅρμα φεύγειν ἄχρι τοῦ Κορινθίων ἰσθμοῦ, τὸν δὲ Οἰνόμαον εὐθέως διώκειν καθωπλισμένον καὶ καταλαβόντα κτείνειν: τὸν δὲ μὴ καταληφθέντα ἔχειν γυναῖκα τὴν Ἱπποδάμειαν. καὶ τοῦτον τὸν τρόπον πολλοὺς μνηστευομένους ἀπέκτεινεν, ὡς δέ τινες λέγουσι δώδεκα: τὰς δὲ κεφαλὰς τῶν μνηστήρων ἐκτεμὼν τῇ οἰκίᾳ προσεπαττάλευε.

[5] For he had arms and horses given him by Ares, and he offered as a prize to the suitors the hand of his daughter, and each suitor was bound to take up Hippodamia on his own chariot and flee as far as the Isthmus of Corinth, and Oenomaus straightway pursued him, in full armour, and if he overtook him he slew him; but if the suitor were not overtaken, he was to have Hippodamia to wife. And in this way he slew many suitors, some say twelve; and he cut off the heads of the suitors and nailed them to his house.

[6] παραγίνεται τοίνυν καὶ Πέλοψ ἐπὶ τὴν μνηστείαν: οὗ τὸ κάλλος ἰδοῦσα ἡ Ἱπποδάμεια ἔρωτα ἔσχεν αὐτοῦ, καὶ πείθει Μυρτίλον τὸν Ἑρμοῦ παῖδα συλλαβέσθαι αὐτῷ: ἦν δὲ Μυρτίλος παρας βάτης εἴτουν ἡνίοχος Οἰνομάου.

[6] So Pelops also came a-wooing; and when Hippodamia saw his beauty, she conceived a passion for him, and persuaded Myrtilus, son of Hermes, to help him; for Myrtilus was charioteer to Oenomaus.

[7] Μυρτίλος οὖν ἐρῶν αὐτῆς καὶ βουλόμενος αὐτῇ χαρίσασθαι, ταῖς χοινικίσι τῶν τροχῶν τοὺς ἥλους οὐκ ἐμβαλὼν ἐποίησε τὸν Οἰνόμαον ἐν τῷ τρέχειν ἡττηθῆναι καὶ ταῖς ἡνίαις συμπλακέντα συρόμενον ἀποθανεῖν, κατὰ δέ τινας ἀναιρεθῆναι ὑπὸ τοῦ Πέλοπος: ὃ ἐν τῷ ἀποθνήσκειν κατηράσατο τῷ Μυρτίλῳ γνοὺς τὴν ἐπιβουλήν, ἵνα ὑπὸ Πέλοπος ἀπόληται.

[7] Accordingly Myrtilus, being in love with her and wishing to gratify her, did not insert the linchpins in the boxes of the wheels, and thus caused Oenomaus to lose the race and to be entangled in the reins and dragged to death; but according to some, he was killed by Pelops. And in dying he cursed Myrtilus, whose treachery he had discovered, praying that he might perish by the hand of Pelops.

[8] λαβὼν οὖν Πέλοψ τὴν Ἱπποδάμειαν καὶ διερχόμενος ἐν τόπῳ τινί, τὸν Μυρτίλον ἔχων μεθ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ, μικρὸν ἀναχωρεῖ κομίσων ὕδωρ διψώσῃ τῇ γυναικί: Μυρτίλος δὲ ἐν τούτῳ βιάζειν αὐτὴν ἐπεχείρει. μαθὼν δὲ τοῦτο παρ᾽ αὐτῆς ὁ Πέλοψ ῥίπτει τὸν Μυρτίλον περὶ Γεραιστὸν ἀκρωτήριον εἰς τὸ ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνου κληθὲν Μυρτῷον πέλαγος: ὁ δὲ ῥιπτούμενος ἀρὰς ἔθετο κατὰ τοῦ Πέλοπος γένους.

[8] Pelops, therefore, got Hippodamia; and on his journey, in which he was accompanied by Myrtilus, he came to a certain place, and withdrew a little to fetch water for his wife, who was athirst; and in the meantime Myrtilus tried to rape her. But when Pelops learned that from her, he threw Myrtilus into the sea, called after him the Myrtoan Sea, at Cape Geraestus; and Myrtilus, as he was being thrown, uttered curses against the house of Pelops.

[9] παραγενόμενος δὲ Πέλοψ ἐπ᾽ ὠκεανὸν καὶ ἁγνισθεὶς ὑπὸ Ἡφαίστου, ἐπανελθὼν εἰς Πῖσαν τῆς Ἤλιδος τὴν Οἰνομάου βασιλείαν λαμβάνει, χειρωσάμενος τὴν πρότερον Ἀπίαν καὶ Πελασγιῶτιν λεγομένην, ἣν ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ Πελοπόννησον ἐκάλεσεν.

[9] When Pelops had reached the Ocean and been cleansed by Hephaestus, he returned to Pisa in Elis and succeeded to the kingdom of Oenomaus, but not till he had subjugated what was formerly called Apia and Pelasgiotis, which he called Peloponnesus after himself.

[10] ὅτι υἱοὶ Πέλοπος Πιτθεὺς Ἀτρεὺς Θυέστης καὶ ἕτεροι: γυνὴ δὲ Ἀτρέως Ἀερόπη τοῦ Κατρέως, ἥτις ἤρα Θυέστου. ὁ δὲ Ἀτρεὺς εὐξάμενός ποτε τῶν αὑτοῦ ποιμνίων, ὅπερ ἂν κάλλιστον γένηται, τοῦτο θῦσαι Ἀρτέμιδι, λέγουσιν ἀρνὸς φανείσης χρυσῆς ὅτι κατημέλησε τῆς εὐχῆς:

[10] The sons of Pelops were Pittheus, Atreus, Thyestes, and others. Now the wife of Atreus was Aerope, daughter of Catreus, and she loved Thyestes. And Atreus once vowed to sacrifice to Artemis the finest of his flocks; but when a golden lamb appeared, they say that he neglected to perform his vow,

[11] πνίξας δὲ αὐτὴν εἰς λάρνακα κατέθετο κἀκεῖ ἐφύλασσε ταύτην: ἣν Ἀερόπη δίδωσι τῷ Θυέστῃ μοιχευθεῖσα ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ. χρησμοῦ γὰρ γεγονότος τοῖς Μυκηναίοις ἑλέσθαι βασιλέα Πελοπίδην, μετεπέμψαντο Ἀτρέα καὶ Θυέστην. λόγου δὲ γενομένου περὶ τῆς βασιλείας ἐξεῖπε Θυέστης τῷ πλήθει τὴν βασιλείαν δεῖν ἔχειν τὸν ἔχοντα τὴν ἄρνα τὴν χρυσῆν: συνθεμένου δὲ τοῦ Ἀτρέως δείξας ἐβασίλευσε.

[11] and having choked the lamb, he deposited it in a box and kept it there, and Aerope gave it to Thyestes, by whom she had been debauched. For the Mycenaeans had received an oracle which bade them choose a Pelopid for their king, and they had sent for Atreus and Thyestes. And when a discussion took place concerning the kingdom, Thyestes declared to the multitude that the kingdom ought to belong to him who owned the golden lamb, and when Atreus agreed, Thyestes produced the lamb and was made king.

[12] Ζεὺς δὲ Ἑρμῆν πέμπει πρὸς Ἀτρέα καὶ λέγει συνθέσθαι πρὸς Θυέστην περὶ τοῦ βασιλεῦσαι Ἀτρέα, εἰ τὴν ἐναντίαν ὁδεύσει ὁ Ἥλιος: Θυέστου δὲ συνθεμένου τὴν δύσιν εἰς ἀνατολὰς ὁ Ἥλιος ἐποιήσατο: ὅθεν ἐκμαρτυρήσαντος τοῦ δαίμονος τὴν Θυέστου πλεονεξίαν, τὴν βασιλείαν Ἀτρεὺς παρέλαβε καὶ Θυέστην ἐφυγάδευσεν.

[12] But Zeus sent Hermes to Atreus and told him to stipulate with Thyestes that Atreus should be king if the sun should go backward; and when Thyestes agreed, the sun set in the east; hence the deity having plainly attested the usurpation of Thyestes, Atreus got the kingdom and banished Thyestes.

[13] αἰσθόμενος δὲ τῆς μοιχείας ὕστερον κήρυκα πέμψας ἐπὶ διαλλαγὰς αὐτὸν ἐκάλει: καὶ ψευσάμενος εἶναι φίλος, παραγενομένου τοὺς παῖδας, οὓς εἶχεν ἐκ νηίδος νύμφης, Ἀγλαὸν καὶ Καλλιλέοντα καὶ Ὀρχομενόν, ἐπὶ τὸν Διὸς βωμὸν καθεσθέντας ἱκέτας ἔσφαξε, καὶ μελίσας καὶ καθεψήσας παρατίθησι Θυέστῃ χωρὶς τῶν ἄκρων, ἐμφορηθέντι δὲ δείκνυσι τὰ ἄκρα καὶ τῆς χώρας αὐτὸν ἐκβάλλει.

[13] But afterwards being apprized of the adultery, he sent a herald to Thyestes with a proposal of accommodation; and when he had lured Thyestes by a pretence of friendship, he slaughtered the sons, Aglaus, Callileon, and Orchomenus, whom Thyestes had by a Naiad nymph, though they had sat down as suppliants on the altar of Zeus. And having cut them limb from limb and boiled them, he served them up to Thyestes without the extremities; and when Thyestes had eaten heartily of them, he showed him the extremities, and cast him out of the country.

[14] Θυέστης δὲ κατὰ πάντα τρόπον ζητῶν Ἀτρέα μετελθεῖν ἐχρηστηριάζετο περὶ τούτου καὶ λαμβάνει χρησμόν, ὡς εἰ παῖδα γεννήσει τῇ θυγατρὶ συνελθών. ποιεῖ οὖν οὕτω καὶ γεννᾷ ἐκ τῆς θυγατρὸς Αἴγισθον, ὃς ἀνδρωθεὶς καὶ μαθών, ὅτι Θυέστου παῖς ἐστι, κτείνας Ἀτρέα Θυέστῃ τὴν βασιλείαν ἀποκατέστησεν.

[14] But seeking by all means to pay Atreus out, Thyestes inquired of the oracle on the subject, and received an answer that it could be done if he were to beget a son by intercourse with his own daughter. He did so accordingly, and begot Aegisthus by his daughter. And Aegisthus, when he was grown to manhood and had learned that he was a son of Thyestes, killed Atreus, and restored the kingdom to Thyestes.

[15]  “τὸν δ᾽ Ἀγαμέμνονα τροφὸς μετὰ τοῦ Μενελάου ἄγει πρὸς Πολυφείδεα, κρατοῦντα Σικυῶνος, ὃς πάλιν τούτους πέπομφε πρὸς Αἰτωλὸν Οἰνέα. μετ᾽ οὐ πολὺ Τυνδάρεως τούτους κατάγει πάλιν, οἳ τὸν Θυέστην μὲν αὐτὸν Ἥρας βωμῷ φυγόντα ὁρκώσαντες διώκουσιν οἰκεῖν τὴν Κυθηρίαν. οἱ δὲ Τυνδάρεω γαμβροὶ γίνονται θυγατράσιν, ὁ Ἀγαμέμνων μὲν λαβὼν σύνευνον Κλυταιμνήστραν, κτείνας αὐτῆς τὸν σύζυγον Τάνταλον τὸν Θυέστου σὺν τέκνῳ πάνυ νεογνῷ, Μενέλαος Ἑλένην. “ Tzetzes, Chiliades,1. 456-465

[15] “ But the nurse took Agamemnon and Menelaus
to Polyphides, lord of Sicyon,
who again sent them to Oeneus, the Aetolian.
Not long afterwards Tyndareus brought them back again,
and they drove away Thyestes to dwell in Cytheria,
after that they had taken an oath of him at the altar of Hera, to which he had fled.
And they became the sons-in-law of Tyndareus by marrying his daughters,
Agamemnon getting Clytaemnestra to wife,
after he had slain her spouse Tantalus, the son of Thyestes,
together with his newborn babe, while Menelaus got Helen.
“

[16] Ἀγαμέμνων δὲ βασιλεύει Μυκηναίων καὶ γαμεῖ Τυνδάρεω θυγατέρα Κλυταιμνήστραν, τὸν πρότερον αὐτῆς ἄνδρα Τάνταλον Θυέστου σὺν τῷ παιδὶ κτείνας, καὶ γίνεται αὐτῷ παῖς μὲν Ὀρέστης, θυγατέρες δὲ Χρυσόθεμις Ἠλέκτρα Ἰφιγένεια. Μενέλαος δὲ Ἑλένην γαμεῖ καὶ βασιλεύει Σπάρτης, Τυνδάρεω τὴν βασιλείαν δόντος αὐτῷ.

[16] And Agamemnon reigned over the Mycenaeans and married Clytaemnestra, daughter of Tyndareus, after slaying her former husband Tantalus, son of Thyestes, with his child. And there were born to Agamemnon a son Orestes, and daughters, Chrysothemis, Electra, and Iphigenia. And Menelaus married Helen and reigned over Sparta, Tyndareus having ceded the kingdom to him.

[1] αὖθις δὲ Ἑλένην Ἀλέξανδρος ἁρπάζει, ὥς τινες λέγουσι κατὰ βούλησιν Διός, ἵνα Εὐρώπης καὶ Ἀσίας εἰς πόλεμον ἐλθούσης ἡ θυγάτηρ αὐτοῦ ἔνδοξος γένηται, ἢ καθάπερ εἶπον ἄλλοι ὅπως τὸ τῶν ἡμιθέων γένος ἀρθῇ.

[1] But afterwards Alexander carried off Helen, as some say, because such was the will of Zeus, in order that his daughter might be famous for having embroiled Europe and Asia; or, as others have said, that the race of the demigods might be exalted.

[2] διὰ δὴ τούτων μίαν αἰτίαν μῆλον περὶ κάλλους Ἔρις ἐμβάλλει Ἥρᾳ καὶ Ἀθηνᾷ καὶ Ἀφροδίτῃ, καὶ κελεύει Ζεὺς Ἑρμῆν εἰς Ἴδην πρὸς Ἀλέξανδρον ἄγειν, ἵνα ὑπ᾽ ἐκείνου διακριθῶσι. αἱ δὲ ἐπαγγέλλονται δῶρα δώσειν Ἀλεξάνδρῳ, Ἥρα μὲν πασῶν προκριθεῖσα βασιλείαν πάντων, Ἀθηνᾶ δὲ πολέμου νίκην, Ἀφροδίτη δὲ γάμον Ἑλένης. ὁ δὲ Ἀφροδίτην προκρίνει καὶ πηξαμένου Φερέκλου ναῦς εἰς Σπάρτην ἐκπλέει.

[2] For one of these reasons Strife threw an apple as a prize of beauty to be contended for by Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite; and Zeus commanded Hermes to lead them to Alexander on Ida in order to be judged by him. And they promised to give Alexander gifts. Hera said that if she were preferred to all women, she would give him the kingdom over all men; and Athena promised victory in war, and Aphrodite the hand of Helen. And he decided in favour of Aphrodite; and sailed away to Sparta with ships built by Phereclus.

[3] ἐφ᾽ ἡμέρας δ᾽ ἐννέα ξενισθεὶς παρὰ Μενελάῳ, τῇ δεκάτῃ πορευθέντος εἰς Κρήτην ἐκείνου κηδεῦσαι τὸν μητροπάτορα Κατρέα, πείθει τὴν Ἑλένην ἀπαγαγεῖν σὺν ἑαυτῷ. ἡ δὲ ἐνναέτη Ἑρμιόνην καταλιποῦσα, ἐνθεμένη τὰ πλεῖστα τῶν χρημάτων, ἀνάγεται τῆς νυκτὸς σὺν αὐτῷ.

[3] For nine days he was entertained by Menelaus; but on the tenth day, Menelaus having gone on a journey to Crete to perform the obsequies of his mother’s father Catreus, Alexander persuaded Helen to go off with him. And she abandoned Hermione, then nine years old, and putting most of the property on board, she set sail with him by night.

[4] Ἥρα δὲ αὐτοῖς ἐπιπέμπει χειμῶνα πολύν, ὑφ᾽ οὗ βιασθέντες προσίσχουσι Σιδῶνι. εὐλαβούμενος δὲ Ἀλέξανδρος μὴ διωχθῇ, πολὺν διέτριψε χρόνον ἐν Φοινίκῃ καὶ Κύπρῳ. ὡς δὲ ἀπήλπισε τὴν δίωξιν, ἧκεν εἰς Τροίαν μετὰ Ἑλένης.

[4] But Hera sent them a heavy storm which forced them to put in at Sidon. And fearing lest he should be pursued, Alexander spent much time in Phoenicia and Cyprus. But when he thought that all chance of pursuit was over, he came to Troy with Helen.

[5] ἔνιοι δέ φασιν Ἑλένην μὲν ὑπὸ Ἑρμοῦ κατὰ βούλησιν Διὸς κομισθῆναι κλαπεῖσαν εἰς Αἴγυπτον καὶ δοθεῖσαν Πρωτεῖ τῷ βασιλεῖ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων φυλάττειν, Ἀλέξανδρον δὲ παραγενέσθαι εἰς Τροίαν πεποιημένον ἐκ νεφῶν εἴδωλον Ἑλένης ἔχοντα.

[5] But some say that Hermes, in obedience to the will of Zeus, stole Helen and carried her to Egypt, and gave her to Proteus, king of the Egyptians, to guard, and that Alexander repaired to Troy with a phantom of Helen fashioned out of clouds.

[6] Μενέλαος δὲ αἰσθόμενος τὴν ἁρπαγὴν ἧκεν εἰς Μυκήνας πρὸς Ἀγαμέμνονα, καὶ δεῖται στρατείαν ἐπὶ Τροίαν ἀθροίζειν καὶ στρατολογεῖν τὴν Ἑλλάδα. ὁ δὲ πέμπων κήρυκα πρὸς ἕκαστον τῶν βασιλέων τῶν ὅρκων ὑπεμίμνησκεν ὧν ὤμοσαν, καὶ περὶ τῆς ἰδίας γυναικὸς ἕκαστον ἀσφαλίζεσθαι παρῄνει, ἴσην λέγων γεγενῆσθαι τὴν τῆς Ἑλλάδος καταφρόνησιν καὶ κοινήν. ὄντων δὲ πολλῶν προθύμων στρατεύεσθαι, παραγίνονται καὶ πρὸς Ὀδυσσέα εἰς Ἰθάκην.

[6] When Menelaus was aware of the rape, he came to Agamemnon at Mycenae, and begged him to muster an army against Troy and to raise levies in Greece. And he, sending a herald to each of the kings, reminded them of the oaths which they had sworn, and warned them to look to the safety each of his own wife, saying that the affront had been offered equally to the whole of Greece. And while many were eager to join in the expedition, some repaired also to Ulysses in Ithaca.

[7] ὁ δὲ οὐ βουλόμενος στρατεύεσθαι προσποιεῖται μανίαν. Παλαμήδης δὲ ὁ Ναυπλίου ἤλεγξε τὴν μανίαν ψευδῆ, καὶ προσποιησαμένῳ μεμηνέναι παρηκολούθει: ἁρπάσας δὲ Τηλέμαχον ἐκ τοῦ κόλπου τῆς Πηνελόπης ὡς κτενῶν ἐξιφούλκει. Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ περὶ τοῦ παιδὸς εὐλαβηθεὶς ὡμολόγησε τὴν προσποίητον μανίαν καὶ στρατεύεται.

[7] But he, not wishing to go to the war, feigned madness. However, Palamedes, son of Nauplius, proved his madness to be fictitious; and when Ulysses pretended to rave, Palamedes followed him, and snatching Telemachus from Penelope’s bosom, drew his sword as if he would kill him. And in his fear for the child Ulysses confessed that his madness was pretended, and he went to the war.

[8] ὅτι Ὀδυσσεὺς λαβὼν αἰχμάλωτον Φρύγα ἠνάγκασε γράψαι περὶ προδοσίας ὡς παρὰ Πριάμου πρὸς Παλαμήδην: καὶ χώσας ἐν ταῖς σκηναῖς αὐτοῦ χρυσὸν τὴν δέλτον ἔρριψεν ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ. Ἀγαμέμνων δὲ ἀναγνοὺς καὶ εὑρὼν τὸν χρυσόν, τοῖς συμμάχοις αὐτὸν ὡς προδότην παρέδωκε καταλεῦσαι.

[8] Having taken a Phrygian prisoner, Ulysses compelled him to write a letter of treasonable purport ostensibly sent by Priam to Palamedes; and having buried gold in the quarters of Palamedes, he dropped the letter in the camp. Agamemnon read the letter, found the gold, and delivered up Palamedes to the allies to be stoned as a traitor.

[9] ὅτι Μενέλαος σὺν Ὀδυσσεῖ καὶ Ταλθυβίῳ πρὸς Κινύραν εἰς Κύπρον ἐλθόντες συμμαχεῖν ἔπειθον: ὁ δὲ Ἀγαμέμνονι μὲν οὐ παρόντι θώρακας ἐδωρήσατο, ὀμόσας δὲ πέμψειν πεντήκοντα ναῦς, μίαν πέμψας, ἧς ἦρχεν ... ὁ Μυγδαλίωνος, καὶ τὰς λοιπὰς ἐκ γῆς πλάσας μεθῆκεν εἰς τὸ πέλαγος.

[9] Menelaus went with Ulysses and Talthybius to Cinyras in Cyprus and tried to persuade him to join the allies. He made a present of breastplates to the absent Agamemnon, and swore he would send fifty ships, but he sent only one, commanded by the son of Mygdalion, and the rest he moulded out of earth and launched them in the sea.

[10] ὅτι θυγατέρες Ἀνίου τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος Ἐλαῒς Σπερμὼ Οἰνώ, αἱ Οἰνότροφοι λεγόμεναι: αἷς ἐχαρίσατο Διόνυσος ποιεῖν ἐκ γῆς ἔλαιον σῖτον οἶνον.

[10] The daughters of Anius, the son of Apollo, to wit, Elais, Spermo, and Oeno, are called the Wine-growers: Dionysus granted them the power of producing oil, corn, and wine from the earth.

[11] The armament mustered in Aulis. The men who went to the Trojan war were as follows: — Of the Boeotians, ten leaders: they brought forty ships. Of the Orchomenians, four: they brought thirty ships. Of the Phocians, four leaders: they brought forty ships. Of the Locrians, Ajax, son of Oeleus: he brought forty ships. Of the Euboeans, Elephenor, son of Chalcodon and Alcyone: he brought forty ships. Of the Athenians, Menestheus: he brought fifty ships. Of the Salaminians, Telamonian Ajax: he brought twelve ships.

[12] Of the Argives, Diomedes, son of Tydeus, and his company: they brought eighty ships. Of the Mycenaeans, Agamemnon, son of Atreus and Aerope: a hundred ships. Of the Lacedaemonians, Menelaus, son of Atreus and Aerope: sixty ships. Of the Pylians, Nestor, son of Neleus and Chloris: forty ships. Of the Arcadians, Agapenor: seven ships. Of the Eleans, Amphimachus and his company: forty ships. Of the Dulichians, Meges, son of Phyleus: forty ships. Of the Cephallenians, Ulysses, son of Laertes and Anticlia: twelve ships.

[14] Of the Myrmidons, Achilles, son of Peleus and Thetis: fifty ships. From Phylace, Protesilaus, son of Iphiclus: forty ships. Of the Pheraeans, Eumelus, son of Admetus: eleven ships. Of the Olizonians, Philoctetes, son of Poeas: seven ships. Of the Aeanianians, Guneus, son of Ocytus: twenty-two ships. Of the Triccaeans, Podalirius:thirty ships. Of the Ormenians, Eurypylus: forty ships. Of the Gyrtonians, Polypoetes, son of Pirithous: thirty ships. Of the Magnesians, Prothous, son of Tenthredon: forty ships. The total of ships was one thousand and thirteen; of leaders, forty-three; of leaderships, thirty.

[15] ὅτι ὄντος ἐν Αὐλίδι τοῦ στρατεύματος, θυσίας γενομένης Ἀπόλλωνι, ὁρμήσας δράκων ἐκ τοῦ βωμοῦ παρὰ τὴν πλησίον πλάτανον, οὔσης ἐν αὐτῇ νεοττιᾶς, τοὺς ἐν αὐτῇ καταναλώσας στρουθοὺς ὀκτὼ σὺν τῇ μητρὶ ἐνάτῃ λίθος ἐγένετο. Κάλχας δὲ εἰπὼν κατὰ Διὸς βούλησιν γεγονέναι αὐτοῖς τὸ σημεῖον τοῦτο, τεκμηράμενος ἐκ τῶν γεγονότων ἔφη δεκαετεῖ χρόνῳ δεῖν Τροίαν ἁλῶναι.

[15] When the armament was in Aulis, after a sacrifice to Apollo, a serpent darted from the altar beside the neighboring plane-tree, in which there was a nest; and having consumed the eight sparrows in the nest, together with the mother bird, which made the ninth, it was turned to stone. Calchas said that this sign was given them by the will of Zeus, and he inferred from what had happened that Troy was destined to be taken in a period of ten years. And they made ready to sail against Troy.

[16] καὶ πλεῖν παρεσκευάζοντο ἐπὶ Τροίαν. Ἀγαμέμνων οὖν αὐτὸς ἡγεμὼν τοῦ σύμπαντος στρατοῦ ἦν, ἐναυάρχει δ᾽ Ἀχιλλεὺς πεντεκαιδεκαέτης τυγχάνων.

[16] So Agamemnon in person was in command of the whole army, and Achilles was admiral, being fifteen years old.

[17] ἀγνοοῦντες δὲ τὸν ἐπὶ Τροίαν πλοῦν Μυσίᾳ προσίσχουσι καὶ ταύτην ἐπόρθουν, Τροίαν νομίζοντες εἶναι. βασιλεύων δὲ Τήλεφος Μυσῶν, Ἡρακλέους παῖς, ἰδὼν τὴν χώραν λεηλατουμένην, τοὺς Μυσοὺς καθοπλίσας ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς συνεδίωκε τοὺς Ἕλληνας καὶ πολλοὺς ἀπέκτεινεν, ἐν οἷς καὶ Θέρσανδρον τὸν Πολυνείκους ὑποστάντα. ὁρμήσαντος δὲ Ἀχιλλέως ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν οὐ μείνας ἐδιώκετο: καὶ διωκόμενος ἐμπλακεὶς εἰς ἀμπέλου κλῆμα τὸν μηρὸν τιτρώσκεται δόρατι.

[17] But not knowing the course to steer for Troy, they put in to Mysia and ravaged it, supposing it to be Troy. Now Telephus son of Hercules, was king of the Mysians, and seeing the country pillaged, he armed the Mysians, chased the Greeks in a crowd to the ships, and killed many, among them Thersander, son of Polynices, who had made a stand. But when Achilles rushed at him, Telephus did not abide the onset and was pursued, and in the pursuit he was entangled in a vine-branch and wounded with a spear in the thigh.

[18] τῆς δὲ Μυσίας ἐξελθόντες Ἕλληνες ἀνάγονται, καὶ χειμῶνος ἐπιγενομένου σφοδροῦ διαζευχθέντες ἀλλήλων εἰς τὰς πατρίδας καταντῶσιν. ὑποστρεψάντων οὖν τῶν Ἑλλήνων τότε λέγεται τὸν πόλεμον εἰκοσαετῆ γενέσθαι: μετὰ γὰρ τὴν Ἑλένης ἁρπαγὴν ἔτει δευτέρῳ τοὺς Ἕλληνας παρασκευασαμένους στρατεύεσθαι, ἀναχωρήσαντας δὲ ἀπὸ Μυσίας εἰς Ἑλλάδα μετὰ ἔτη ὀκτὼ πάλιν εἰς Ἄργος μεταστραφέντας ἐλθεῖν εἰς Αὐλίδα.

[18] Departing from Mysia, the Greeks put to sea, and a violent storm coming on, they were separated from each other and landed in their own countries. So the Greeks returned at that time, and it is said that the war lasted twenty years. For it was in the second year after the rape of Helen that the Greeks, having completed their preparations, set out on the expedition and after their retirement from Mysia to Greece eight years elapsed before they again returned to Argos and came to Aulis.

[19] συνελθόντων δὲ αὐτῶν ἐν Ἄργει αὖθις μετὰ τὴν ῥηθεῖσαν ὀκταετίαν, ἐν ἀπορίᾳ τοῦ πλοῦ πολλῇ καθεστήκεσαν, καθηγεμόνα μὴ ἔχοντες, ὃς ἦν δυνατὸς δεῖξαι τὴν εἰς Τροίαν.

[19] Having again assembled at Aulis after the aforesaid interval of eight years, they were in great perplexity about the voyage, because they had no leader who could show them the way to Troy.

[20] Τήλεφος δὲ ἐκ τῆς Μυσίας, ἀνίατον τὸ τραῦμα ἔχων, εἰπόντος αὐτῷ τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος τότε τεύξεσθαι θεραπείας, ὅταν ὁ τρώσας ἰατρὸς γένηται, τρύχεσιν ἠμφιεσμένος εἰς Ἄργος ἀφίκετο, καὶ δεηθεὶς Ἀχιλλέως καὶ ὑπεσχημένος τὸν εἰς Τροίαν πλοῦν δεῖξαι θεραπεύεται ἀποξύσαντος Ἀχιλλέως τῆς Πηλιάδος μελίας τὸν ἰόν. θεραπευθεὶς οὖν ἔδειξε τὸν πλοῦν, τὸ τῆς δείξεως ἀσφαλὲς πιστουμένου τοῦ Κάλχαντος διὰ τῆς ἑαυτοῦ μαντικῆς.

[20] But Telephus, because his wound was unhealed, and Apollo had told him that he would be cured when the one who wounded him should turn physician, came from Mysia to Argos, clad in rags, and begged the help of Achilles, promising to show the course to steer for Troy. So Achilles healed him by scraping off the rust of his Pelian spear. Accordingly, on being healed, Telephus showed the course to steer, and the accuracy of his information was confirmed by Calchas by means of his own art of divination.

[21] ἀναχθέντων δὲ αὐτῶν ἀπ᾽ Ἄργους καὶ παραγενομένων τὸ δεύτερον εἰς Αὐλίδα,τὸν στόλον ἄπλοια κατεῖχε: Κάλχας δὲ ἔφη οὐκ ἄλλως δύνασθαι πλεῖν αὐτούς, εἰ μὴ τῶν Ἀγαμέμνονος θυγατέρων ἡ κρατιστεύουσα κάλλει σφάγιον Ἀρτέμιδι παραστῇ, διὰ τὸ μηνίειν τὴν θεὸν τῷ Ἀγαμέμνονι, ὅτι τε βαλὼν ἔλαφον εἶπεν: οὐδὲ ἡ Ἄρτεμις, καὶ ὅτι Ἀτρεὺς οὐκ ἔθυσεν αὐτῇ τὴν χρυσῆν ἄρνα.

[21] But when they had put to sea from Argos and arrived for the second time at Aulis, the fleet was windbound, and Calchas said that they could not sail unless the fairest of Agamemnon’s daughters were presented as a sacrifice to Artemis; for the goddess was angry with Agamemnon, both because, on shooting a deer, he had said, “ Artemis herself could not （ do it better）,” and because Atreus had not sacrificed to her the golden lamb.

[22] τοῦ δὲ χρησμοῦ τούτου γενομένου, πέμψας Ἀγαμέμνων πρὸς Κλυταιμνήστραν Ὀδυσσέα καὶ Ταλθύβιον Ἰφιγένειαν ᾔτει, λέγων ὑπεσχῆσθαι δώσειν αὐτὴν Ἀχιλλεῖ γυναῖκα μισθὸν τῆς στρατείας.πεμψάσης δὲ ἐκείνης Ἀγαμέμνων τῷ βωμῷ παραστήσας ἔμελλε σφάζειν,Ἄρτεμις δὲ αὐτὴν ἁρπάσασα εἰς Ταύρους ἱέρειαν ἑαυτῆς κατέστησεν, ἔλαφον ἀντ᾽ αὐτῆς παραστήσασα τῷ βωμῷ:ὡς δὲ ἔνιοι λέγουσιν, ἀθάνατον αὐτὴν ἐποίησεν.

[22] On receipt of this oracle, Agamemnon sent Ulysses and Talthybius to Clytaemnestra and asked for Iphigenia, alleging a promise of his to give her to Achilles to wife in reward for his military service. So Clytaemnestra sent her, and Agamemnon set her beside the altar, and was about to slaughter her, when Artemis carried her off to the Taurians and appointed her to be her priestess, substituting a deer for her at the altar; but some say that Artemis made her immortal.

[23] οἱ δὲ ἀναχθέντες ἐξ Αὐλίδος προσέσχον Τενέδῳ. ταύτης ἐβασίλευε Τένης ὁ Κύκνου καὶ Προκλείας, ὡς δέ τινες Ἀπόλλωνος: οὗτος ὑπὸ τοῦ πατρὸς φυγαδευθεὶς ἐνταῦθα κατῴκει.

[23] After putting to sea from Aulis they touched at Tenedos. It was ruled by Tenes, son of Cycnus and Proclia, but according to some, he was a son of Apollo. He dwelt there because he had been banished by his father.

[24] Κύκνος γὰρ ἔχων ἐκ Προκλείας τῆς Λαομέδοντος παῖδα μὲν Τένην, θυγατέρα δὲ Ἡμιθέαν, ἐπέγημε τὴν Τραγάσου Φιλονόμην: ἥτις Τένου ἐρασθεῖσα καὶ μὴ πείθουσα καταψεύδεται πρὸς Κύκνον αὐτοῦ φθοράν, καὶ τούτου μάρτυρα παρεῖχεν αὐλητὴν Εὔμολπον ὄνομα.

[24] For Cycnus had a son Tenes and a daughter Hemithea by Proclia, daughter of Laomedon, but he afterwards married Philonome, daughter of Tragasus; and she fell in love with Tenes, and, failing to seduce him, falsely accused him to Cycnus of attempting to debauch her, and in witness of it she produced a flute-player, by name Eumolpus.

[25] Κύκνος δὲ πιστεύσας, ἐνθέμενος αὐτὸν μετὰ τῆς ἀδελφῆς εἰς λάρνακα μεθῆκεν εἰς τὸ πέλαγος: προσσχούσης δὲ αὐτῆς Λευκόφρυι νήσῳ ἐκβὰς ὁ Τένης κατῴκησε ταύτην καὶ ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ Τένεδον ἐκάλεσε. Κύκνος δὲ ὕστερον ἐπιγνοὺς τὴν ἀλήθειαν τὸν μὲν αὐλητὴν κατέλευσε, τὴν δὲ γυναῖκα ζῶσαν εἰς γῆν κατέχωσε.

[25] Cycnus believed her, and putting him and his sister in a chest he set them adrift on the sea. The chest was washed up on the island of Leucophrys, and Tenes landed and settled in the island, and called it Tenedos after himself. But Cycnus afterwards learning the truth, stoned the flute-player to death and buried his wife alive in the earth.

[26] προσπλέοντας οὖν Τενέδῳ τοὺς Ἕλληνας ὁρῶν Τένης ἀπεῖργε βάλλων πέτρους, καὶ ὑπὸ Ἀχιλλέως ξίφει πληγεὶς κατὰ τὸ στῆθος θνήσκει, καίτοι Θέτιδος προειπούσης Ἀχιλλεῖ μὴ κτεῖναι Τένην: τεθνήξεσθαι γὰρ ὑπὸ Ἀπόλλωνος αὐτόν, ἐὰν κτείνῃ Τένην.

[26] So when the Greeks were standing in for Tenedos, Tenes saw them and tried to keep them off by throwing stones, but was killed by Achilles with a sword-cut in the breast, though Thetis had forewarned Achilles not to kill Tenes, because he himself would die by the hand of Apollo if he slew Tenes.

[27] τελούντων δὲ αὐτῶν Ἀπόλλωνι θυσίαν, ἐκ τοῦ βωμοῦ προσελθὼν ὕδρος δάκνει Φιλοκτήτην: ἀθεραπεύτου δὲ τοῦ ἕλκους καὶ δυσώδους γενομένου τῆς τε ὀδμῆς οὐκ ἀνεχομένου τοῦ στρατοῦ, Ὀδυσσεὺς αὐτὸν εἰς Λῆμνον μεθ᾽ ὧν εἶχε τόξων Ἡρακλείων ἐκτίθησι κελεύσαντος Ἀγαμέμνονος. ὁ δὲ ἐκεῖ τὰ πτηνὰ τοξεύων ἐπὶ τῆς ἐρημίας τροφὴν εἶχεν.

[27] and as they were offering a sacrifice to Apollo, a water-snake approached from the altar and bit Philoctetes; and as the sore did not heal and grew noisome, the army could not endure the stench, and Ulysses, by the orders of Agamemnon, put him ashore on the island of Lemnos, with the bow of Hercules which he had in his possession; and there, by shooting birds with the bow, he subsisted in the wilderness.

[28] ἀναχθέντες δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς Τενέδου προσέπλεον Τροίᾳ, καὶ πέμπουσιν Ὀδυσσέα καὶ Μενέλαον τὴν Ἑλένην καὶ τὰ χρήματα ἀπαιτοῦντας. συναθροισθείσης δὲ παρὰ τοῖς Τρωσὶν ἐκκλησίας, οὐ μόνον τὴν Ἑλένην οὐκ ἀπεδίδουν ἀλλὰ καὶ τούτους κτείνειν ἤθελον.

[28] Putting to sea from Tenedos they made sail for Troy, and sent Ulysses and Menelaus to demand the restoration of Helen and the property. But the Trojans, having summoned an assembly, not only refused to restore Helen, but threatened to kill the envoys.

[29] ἀλλὰ τοὺς μὲν ἔσωσεν Ἀντήνωρ, οἱ δὲ Ἕλληνες, ἀχθόμενοι ἐπὶ τῇ τῶν βαρβάρων καταφρονήσει, ἀναλαβόντες τὴν πανοπλίαν ἔπλεον ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς. Ἀχιλλεῖ δὲ ἐπιστέλλει Θέτις πρῶτον μὴ ἀποβῆναι τῶν νεῶν: τὸν γὰρ ἀποβάντα πρῶτον πρῶτον μέλλειν τελευτήσειν.πυθόμενοι δὲ οἱ βάρβαροι τὸν στόλον ἐπιπλεῖν, σὺν ὅπλοις ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν ὥρμησαν καὶ βάλλοντες πέτροις ἀποβῆναι ἐκώλυον.

[29] These were, however, saved by Antenor; but the Greeks, exasperated at the insolence of the barbarians, stood to arms and made sail against them. Now Thetis charged Achilles not to be the first to land from the ships, because the first to land would be the first to die. Being apprized of the hostile approach of the fleet, the barbarians marched in arms to the sea, and endeavored by throwing stones to prevent the landing.

[30] τῶν δὲ Ἑλλήνων πρῶτος ἀπέβη τῆς νεὼς Πρωτεσίλαος, καὶ κτείνας οὐκ ὀλίγους τῶν βαρβάρων ὑφ᾽ Ἕκτορος θνήσκει. τούτου ἡ γυνὴ Λαοδάμεια καὶ μετὰ θάνατον ἤρα, καὶ ποιήσασα εἴδωλον Πρωτεσιλάῳ παραπλήσιον τούτῳ προσωμίλει.Ἑρμῆς δὲ ἐλεησάντων θεῶν ἀνήγαγε Πρωτεσίλαον ἐξ Ἅιδου. Λαοδάμεια δὲ ἰδοῦσα καὶ νομίσασα αὐτὸν ἐκ Τροίας παρεῖναι τότε μὲν ἐχάρη, πάλιν δὲ ἐπαναχθέντος εἰς Ἅιδου ἑαυτὴν ἐφόνευσεν.

[30] Of the Greeks the first to land from his ship was Protesilaus, and having slain not a few of the barbarians, he fell by the hand of Hector. His wife Laodamia loved him even after his death, and she made an image of him and consorted with it. The gods had pity on her, and Hermes brought up Protesilaus from Hades. On seeing him, Laodamia thought it was himself returned from Troy, and she was glad; but when he was carried back to Hades, she stabbed herself to death.

[31] Πρωτεσιλάου δὲ τελευτήσαντος, ἐκβαίνει μετὰ Μυρμιδόνων Ἀχιλλεὺς καὶ λίθον βαλὼν εἰς τὴν κεφαλὴν Κύκνου κτείνει. ὡς δὲ τοῦτον νεκρὸν εἶδον οἱ βάρβαροι, φεύγουσιν εἰς τὴν πόλιν, οἱ δὲ Ἕλληνες ἐκπηδήσαντες τῶν νεῶν ἐνέπλησαν σωμάτων τὸ πεδίον. καὶ κατακλείσαντες τοὺς Τρῶας ἐπολιόρκουν:

[31] On the death of Protesilaus, Achilles landed with the Myrmidons, and throwing a stone at the head of Cycnus, killed him. When the barbarians saw him dead, they fled to the city, and the Greeks, leaping from their ships, filled the plain with bodies. and having shut up the Trojans, they besieged them; and they drew up the ships.

[32] ἀνέλκουσι δὲ τὰς ναῦς. μὴ θαρρούντων δὲ τῶν βαρβάρων, Ἀχιλλεὺς ἐνεδρεύσας Τρωίλον ἐν τῷ τοῦ Θυμβραίου Ἀπόλλωνος ἱερῷ φονεύει, καὶ νυκτὸς ἐλθὼν ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν Λυκάονα λαμβάνει. παραλαβὼν δὲ Ἀχιλλεύς τινας τῶν ἀριστέων τὴν χώραν ἐπόρθει, καὶ παραγίνεται εἰς Ἴδην ἐπὶ τὰς Αἰνείου τοῦ Πριάμου βόας. φυγόντος δὲ αὐτοῦ, τοὺς βουκόλους κτείνας καὶ Μήστορα τὸν Πριάμου τὰς βόας ἐλαύνει.

[32] The barbarians showing no courage, Achilles waylaid Troilus and slaughtered him in the sanctuary of Thymbraean Apollo, and coming by night to the city he captured Lycaon. Moreover, taking some of the chiefs with him, Achilles laid waste the country, and made his way to Ida to lift the kine of Aeneas. But Aeneas fled, and Achilles killed the neatherds and Nestor, son of Priam, and drove away the kine.

[33] αἱρεῖ δὲ καὶ Λέσβον καὶ Φώκαιαν, εἶτα Κολοφῶνα καὶ Σμύρναν καὶ Κλαζομενὰς καὶ Κύμην, μεθ᾽ ἃς Αἰγιαλὸν καὶ Τῆνον, τὰς ἑκατὸν καλουμένας πόλεις: εἶτα ἑξῆς Ἀδραμύτιον καὶ Σίδην, εἶτα Ἔνδιον καὶ Λιναῖον καὶ Κολώνην. αἱρεῖ δὲ καὶ Θήβας τὰς Ὑποπλακίας καὶ Λυρνησσόν, ἔτι δὲ καὶ Ἄντανδρον καὶ ἄλλας πολλάς.

[33] He also took Lesbos and Phocaea, then Colophon, and Smyrna, and Clazomenae, and Cyme; and afterwards Aegialus and Tenos, the so-called Hundred Cities; then, in order, Adramytium and Side; then Endium, and Linaeum, and Colone. He took also Hypoplacian Thebes and Lyrnessus, and further Antandrus, and many other cities.

[34] ἐνναετοῦς δὲ χρόνου διελθόντος παραγίνονται τοῖς Τρωσὶ σύμμαχοι: ἐκ τῶν περιοίκων πόλεων Αἰνείας Ἀγχίσου καὶ σὺν αὐτῷ Ἀρχέλοχος καὶ Ἀκάμας Ἀντήνορος καὶ Θεανοῦς, Δαρδανίων ἡγούμενοι, Θρᾳκῶν Ἀκάμας Εὐσώρου, Κικόνων Εὔφημος Τροιζήνου, Παιόνων Πυραίχμης, Παφλαγόνων Πυλαιμένης Βιλσάτου,

[34] A period of nine years having elapsed, allies came to join the Trojans: from the surrounding cities, Aeneas, son of Anchises, and with him Archelochus and Acamas, sons of Antenor, and Theanus, leaders of the Dardanians; of the Thracians, Acamas, son of Eusorus; of the Cicones, Euphemus, son of Troezenus; of the Paeonians, Pyraechmes; of the Paphlagonians, Pylaemenes, son of Bilsates;

[35] ἐκ Ζελίας Πάνδαρος Λυκάονος, ἐξ Ἀδραστείας Ἄδραστος καὶ Ἄμφιος Μέροπος, ἐκ δ᾽ Ἀρίσβης Ἄσιος Ὑρτάκου, ἐκ Λαρίσσης Ἱππόθοος Πελασγοῦ, ἐκ Μυσίας Χρόμιος καὶ Ἔννομος Ἀρσινόου, Ἀλιζώνων Ὀδίος καὶ Ἐπίστροφος Μηκιστέως, Φρυγῶν Φόρκυς καὶ Ἀσκάνιος Ἀρετάονος, Μαιόνων Μέσθλης καὶ Ἄντιφος Ταλαιμένους, Καρῶν Νάστης καὶ Ἀμφίμαχος Νομίονος, Λυκίων Σαρπηδὼν Διὸς καὶ Γλαῦκος Ἱππολόχου.

[35] from Zelia, Pandarus, son of Lycaon; from Adrastia, Adrastus and Amphius, sons of Merops; from Arisbe, Asius, son of Hyrtacus; from Larissa, Hippothous, son of Pelasgus; from Mysia, Chromius and Ennomus, sons of Arsinous; of the Alizones, Odius and Epistrophus, sons of Mecisteus; of the Phrygians, Phorcys and Ascanius, sons of Aretaon; of the Maeonians, Mesthles and Antiphus, sons of Talaemenes; of the Carians, Nastes and Amphimachus, sons of Nomion; of the Lycians, Sarpedon, son of Zeus, and Glaucus, son of Hippolochus.

[1] Ἀχιλλεὺς δὲ μηνίων ἐπὶ τὸν πόλεμον οὐκ ἐξῄει διὰ Βρισηίδα ... τῆς θυγατρὸς Χρύσου τοῦ ἱερέως. διὸ θαρσήσαντες οἱ βάρβαροι ἐκ τῆς πόλεως προῆλθον. καὶ μονομαχεῖ Ἀλέξανδρος πρὸς Μενέλαον, Ἀλέξανδρον δὲ ἡττώμενον ἁρπάζει Ἀφροδίτη. Πάνδαρος δὲ τοξεύσας Μενέλαον τοὺς ὅρκους ἔλυσεν.

[1] Achilles did not go forth to the war, because he was angry on account of Briseis, ... the daughter of Chryses the priest. Therefore the barbarians took heart of grace and sallied out of the city. And Alexander fought a single combat with Menelaus; and when Alexander got the worst of it, Aphrodite carried him off. And Pandarus, by shooting an arrow at Menelaus, broke the truce.

[2] ὅτι Διομήδης ἀριστεύων Ἀφροδίτην Αἰνείᾳ βοηθοῦσαν τιτρώσκει, καὶ Γλαύκῳ συστάς, ὑπομνησθεὶς πατρῴας φιλίας, ἀλλάσσει τὰ ὅπλα.προκαλουμένου δὲ Ἕκτορος τὸν ἄριστον εἰς μονομαχίαν, πολλῶν ἐλθόντων Αἴας κληρωσάμενος ἀριστεύει: νυκτὸς δὲ ἐπιγενομένης κήρυκες διαλύουσιν αὐτούς.

[2] Diomedes, doing doughty deeds, wounded Aphrodite when she came to the help of Aeneas; and encountering Glaucus, he recalled the friendship of their fathers and exchanged arms. And Hector having challenged the bravest to single combat, many came forward, but the lot fell on Ajax, and he did doughty deeds; but night coming on, the heralds parted them.

[3] οἱ δὲ Ἕλληνες πρὸς τοῦ ναυστάθμου τεῖχος ποιοῦνται καὶ τάφρον, καὶ γενομένης μάχης ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ οἱ Τρῶες τοὺς Ἕλληνας εἰς τὸ τεῖχος διώκουσιν: οἱ δὲ πέμπουσι πρὸς Ἀχιλλέα πρέσβεις Ὀδυσσέα καὶ Φοίνικα καὶ Αἴαντα, συμμαχεῖν ἀξιοῦντες καὶ Βρισηίδα καὶ ἄλλα δῶρα ὑπισχνούμενοι.

[3] The Greeks made a wall and a ditch to protect the roadstead, and a battle taking place in the plain, the Trojans chased the Greeks within the wall. But the Greeks sent Ulysses, Phoenix, and Ajax as ambassadors to Achilles, begging him to fight for them, and promising Briseis and other gifts.

[4] νυκτὸς δὲ ἐπιγενομένης κατασκόπους πέμπουσιν Ὀδυσσέα καὶ Διομήδην: οἱ δὲ ἀναιροῦσι Δόλωνα τὸν Εὐμήλου καὶ Ῥῆσον τὸν Θρᾷκα （ὃς πρὸ μιᾶς ἡμέρας παραγενόμενος Τρωσὶ σύμμαχος οὐ συμβαλὼν ἀπωτέρω τῆς Τρωικῆς δυνάμεως χωρὶς Ἕκτορος ἐστρατοπέδευσε） τούς τε περὶ αὐτὸν δώδεκα κοιμωμένους κτείνουσι καὶ τοὺς ἵππους ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς ἄγουσι.

[4] And night coming on, they sent Ulysses and Diomedes as spies; and these killed Dolon, son of Eumelus, and Rhesus, the Thracian （ who had arrived the day before as an ally of the Trojans, and having not yet engaged in the battle was encamped at some distance from the Trojan force and apart from Hector）; they also slew the twelve men that were sleeping around him, and drove the horses to the ships.

[5] μεθ᾽ ἡμέραν δὲ ἰσχυρᾶς μάχης γενομένης, τρωθέντων Ἀγαμέμνονος καὶ Διομήδους Ὀδυσσέως Εὐρυπύλου Μαχάονος καὶ τροπῆς τῶν Ἑλλήνων γενομένης, Ἕκτωρ ῥήξας τὸ τεῖχος εἰσέρχεται καὶ ἀναχωρήσαντος Αἴαντος πῦρ ἐμβάλλει ταῖς ναυσίν.

[5] But by day a fierce fight took place; Agamemnon and Diomedes, Ulysses, Eurypylus, and Machaon were wounded, the Greeks were put to flight Hector made a breach in the wall and entered and, Ajax having retreated, he set fire to the ships.

[6] ὡς δὲ εἶδεν Ἀχιλλεὺς τὴν Πρωτεσιλάου ναῦν καιομένην, ἐκπέμπει Πάτροκλον καθοπλίσας τοῖς ἰδίοις ὅπλοις μετὰ τῶν Μυρμιδόνων, δοὺς αὐτῷ τοὺς ἵππους. ἰδόντες δὲ αὐτὸν οἱ Τρῶες καὶ νομίσαντες Ἀχιλλέα εἶναι εἰς φυγὴν τρέπονται. καταδιώξας δὲ αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸ τεῖχος πολλοὺς ἀναιρεῖ, ἐν οἷς καὶ Σαρπηδόνα τὸν Διός, καὶ ὑφ᾽ Ἕκτορος ἀναιρεῖται, τρωθεὶς πρότερον ὑπὸ Εὐφόρβου.

[6] But when Achilles saw the ship of Protesilaus burning, he sent out Patroclus with the Myrmidons, after arming him with his own arms and giving him the horses. Seeing him the Trojans thought that he was Achilles and turned to flee. And having chased them within the wall, he killed many, amongst them Sarpedon, son of Zeus, and was himself killed by Hector, after being first wounded by Euphorbus.

[7] μάχης δὲ ἰσχυρᾶς γενομένης περὶ τοῦ νεκροῦ, μόλις Αἴας ἀριστεύσας σώζει τὸ σῶμα. Ἀχιλλεὺς δὲ τὴν ὀργὴν ἀποθέμενος καὶ τὴν Βρισηίδα κομίζεται. καὶ πανοπλίας αὐτῷ κομισθείσης παρὰ Ἡφαίστου, καθοπλισάμενος ἐπὶ τὸν πόλεμον ἐξέρχεται, καὶ συνδιώκει τοὺς Τρῶας ἐπὶ τὸν Σκάμανδρον, κἀκεῖ πολλοὺς μὲν ἄλλους ἀναιρεῖ, κτείνει δὲ καὶ Ἀστεροπαῖον τὸν Πηλεγόνος τοῦ Ἀξιοῦ ποταμοῦ: καὶ αὐτῷ λάβρος ὁ ποταμὸς ἐφορμᾷ. καὶ τούτου μὲν ὁ Ἥφαιστος τὰ ῥεῖθρα ἀναξηραίνει πολλῇ φλογὶ διώξας, ὁ δ᾽ Ἀχιλλεὺς Ἕκτορα ἐκ μονομαχίας ἀναιρεῖ καὶ ἐξάψας αὐτοῦ τὰ σφυρὰ ἐκ τοῦ ἅρματος σύρων ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς παραγίνεται. καὶ θάψας Πάτροκλον ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ ἀγῶνα τίθησιν, ἐν ᾧ νικᾷ ἵπποις Διομήδης, Ἐπειὸς πυγμῇ, Αἴας καὶ Ὀδυσσεὺς πάλῃ. μετὰ δὲ τὸν ἀγῶνα παραγενόμενος Πρίαμος πρὸς Ἀχιλλέα λυτροῦται τὸ Ἕκτορος σῶμα καὶ θάπτει.

[7] And a fierce fight taking place for the corpse, Ajax with difficulty, by performing feats of valor, rescued the body. And Achilles laid aside his anger and recovered Briseis. And a suit of armour having been brought him from Hephaestus, he donned the armour and went forth to the war, and chased the Trojans in a crowd to the Scamander, and there killed many, and amongst them Asteropaeus, son of Pelegon, son of the river Axius; and the river rushed at him in fury. But Hephaestus dried up the streams of the river, after chasing them with a mighty flame. And Achilles slew Hector in single combat, and fastening his ankles to his chariot dragged him to the ships. And having buried Patroclus, he celebrated games in his honor, at which Diomedes was victorious in the chariot race, Epeus in boxing, and Ajax and Ulysses in wrestling. And after the games Priam came to Achilles and ransomed the body of Hector, and buried it.

[1] ὅτι Πενθεσίλεια, Ὀτρηρῆς καὶ Ἄρεος, ἀκουσίως Ἱππολύτην κτείνασα καὶ ὑπὸ Πριάμου καθαρθεῖσα, μάχης γενομένης πολλοὺς κτείνει, ἐν οἷς καὶ Μαχάονα: εἶθ᾽ ὕστερον θνήσκει ὑπὸ Ἀχιλλέως, ὅστις μετὰ θάνατον ἐρασθεὶς τῆς Ἀμαζόνος κτείνει Θερσίτην λοιδοροῦντα αὐτόν.

[1] Penthesilia, daughter of Otrere and Ares, accidentally killed Hippolyte and was purified by Priam. In battle she slew many, and amongst them Machaon, and was afterwards herself killed by Achilles, who fell in love with the Amazon after her death and slew Thersites for jeering at him.

[2] ἦν δὲ Ἱππολύτη ἡ τοῦ Ἱππολύτου μήτηρ, ἡ καὶ Γλαύκη καὶ Μελανίππη. αὕτη γάρ, ἐπιτελουμένων τῶν γάμων Φαίδρας, ἐπιστᾶσα σὺν ὅπλοις ἅμα ταῖς μεθ᾽ ἑαυτῆς Ἀμαζόσιν ἔλεγε κτείνειν τοὺς συνανακειμένους Θησεῖ. μάχης οὖν γενομένης ἀπέθανεν, εἴτε ὑπὸ τῆς συμμάχου Πενθεσιλείας ἀκούσης, εἴτε ὑπὸ Θησέως, εἴτε ὅτι οἱ περὶ Θησέα, τὴν τῶν Ἀμαζόνων ἑωρακότες ἐπιστασίαν, κλείσαντες διὰ τάχους τὰς θύρας καὶ ταύτην ἀπολαβόντες ἐντὸς ἀπέκτειναν.

[2] Hippolyte was the mother of Hippolytus; she also goes by the names of Glauce and Melanippe. For when the marriage of Phaedra was being celebrated, Hippolyte appeared in arms with her Amazons, and said that she would slay the guests of Theseus. So a battle took place, and she was killed, whether involuntarily by her ally Penthesilia, or by Theseus, or because his men, seeing the threatening attitude of the Amazons, hastily closed the doors and so intercepted and slew her.

[3] ὅτι Μέμνονα τὸν Τιθωνοῦ καὶ Ἠοῦς μετὰ πολλῆς Αἰθιόπων δυνάμεως παραγενόμενον ἐν Τροίᾳ καθ᾽ Ἑλλήνων καὶ πολλοὺς τῶν Ἑλλήνων κτείναντα καὶ Ἀντίλοχον κτείνει ὁ Ἀχιλλεύς. διώξας δὲ καὶ τοὺς Τρῶας πρὸς ταῖς Σκαιαῖς πύλαις τοξεύεται ὑπὸ Ἀλεξάνδρου καὶ Ἀπόλλωνος εἰς τὸ σφυρόν.

[3] Memnon, the son of Tithonus and the Dawn, came with a great force of Ethiopians to Troy against the Greeks, and having slain many of the Greeks, including Antilochus, he was himself slain by Achilles. Having chased the Trojans also, Achilles was shot with an arrow in the ankle by Alexander and Apollo at the Scaean gate.

[4] γενομένης δὲ μάχης περὶ τοῦ νεκροῦ, Αἴας Γλαῦκον ἀναιρεῖ, καὶ τὰ ὅπλα δίδωσιν ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς κομίζειν, τὸ δὲ σῶμα βαστάσας Αἴας βαλλόμενος βέλεσι μέσον τῶν πολεμίων διήνεγκεν, Ὀδυσσέως πρὸς τοὺς ἐπιφερομένους μαχομένου.

[4] A fight taking place for the corpse, Ajax killed Glaucus, and gave the arms to be conveyed to the ships, but the body he carried, in a shower of darts, through the midst of the enemy, while Ulysses fought his assailants.

[5] Ἀχιλλέως δὲ ἀποθανόντος συμφορᾶς ἐπληρώθη τὸ στράτευμα.θάπτουσι δὲ αὐτὸν ἐν Λευκῇ νήσῳ μετὰ Πατρόκλου, τὰ ἑκατέρων ὀστᾶ συμμίξαντες. λέγεται δὲ μετὰ θάνατον Ἀχιλλεὺς ἐν Μακάρων νήσοις Μηδείᾳ συνοικεῖν.τιθέασι δὲ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ ἀγῶνα, ἐν ᾧ νικᾷ Εὔμηλος ἵπποις, Διομήδης σταδίῳ, Αἴας δίσκῳ, Τεῦκρος τόξῳ.

[5] The death of Achilles filled the army with dismay, and they buried him with Patroclus in the White Isle, mixing the bones of the two together. It is said that after death Achilles consorts with Medea in the Isles of the Blest. And they held games in his honor, at which Eumelus won the chariot-race, Diomedes the footrace, Ajax the quoit match, and Teucer the competition in archery.

[6] ἡ δὲ πανοπλία αὐτοῦ τῷ ἀρίστῳ νικητήριον τίθεται, καὶ καταβαίνουσιν εἰς ἅμιλλαν Αἴας καὶ Ὀδυσσεύς.καὶ κρινάντων τῶν Τρώων, ὡς δέ τινες τῶν συμμάχων,Ὀδυσσεὺς προκρίνεται. Αἴας δὲ ὑπὸ λύπης ταραχθεὶς ἐπιβουλεύεται νύκτωρ τῷ στρατεύματι, καὶ αὐτῷ μανίαν ἐμβαλοῦσα Ἀθηνᾶ εἰς τὰ βοσκήματα ἐκτρέπει ξιφήρη: ὁ δὲ ἐκμανεὶς σὺν τοῖς νέμουσι τὰ βοσκήματα ὡς Ἀχαιοὺς φονεύει.

[6] Also his arms were offered as a prize to the bravest, and Ajax and Ulysses came forward as competitors. The judges were the Trojans or, according to some, the allies, and Ulysses was preferred. Disordered by chagrin, Ajax planned a nocturnal attack on the army. And Athena drove him mad, and turned him, sword in hand, among the cattle, and in his frenzy he slaughtered the cattle with the herdsmen, taking them for the Achaeans.

[7] ὕστερον δὲ σωφρονήσας κτείνει καὶ ἑαυτόν. Ἀγαμέμνων δὲ κωλύει τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ καῆναι, καὶ μόνος οὗτος τῶν ἐν Ἰλίῳ ἀποθανόντων ἐν σορῷ κεῖται: ὁ δὲ τάφος ἐστὶν ἐν Ῥοιτείῳ.

[7] But afterwards he came to his senses and slew also himself. And Agamemnon forbade his body to be burnt; and he alone of all who fell at Ilium is buried, in a coffin. His grave is at Rhoeteum.

[8] ἤδη δὲ ὄντος τοῦ πολέμου δεκαετοῦς ἀθυμοῦσι τοῖς ἝλλησιΚάλχας θεσπίζει, οὐκ ἄλλως ἁλῶναι δύνασθαι Τροίαν, ἂν μὴ τὰ Ἡρακλέους ἔχωσι τόξα συμμαχοῦντα. τοῦτο ἀκούσας Ὀδυσσεὺς μετὰ Διομήδους εἰς Λῆμνον ἀφικνεῖται πρὸς Φιλοκτήτην, καὶ δόλῳ ἐγκρατὴς γενόμενος τῶν τόξων πείθει πλεῖν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ Τροίαν. ὁ δὲ παραγενόμενος καὶ θεραπευθεὶς ὑπὸ Ποδαλειρίου Ἀλέξανδρον τοξεύει.

[8] When the war had already lasted ten years, and the Greeks were despondent, Calchas prophesied to them that Troy could not be taken unless they had the bow and arrows of Hercules fighting on their side. On hearing that, Ulysses went with Diomedes to Philoctetes in Lemnos, and having by craft got possession of the bow and arrows he persuaded him to sail to Troy. So he went, and after being cured by Podalirius, he shot Alexander.

[9] τούτου δὲ ἀποθανόντος εἰς ἔριν ἔρχονται Ἕλενος καὶ Δηίφοβος ὑπὲρ τῶν Ἑλένης γάμων: προκριθέντος δὲ τοῦ Δηιφόβου Ἕλενος ἀπολιπὼν Τροίαν ἐν Ἴδῃ διετέλει. εἰπόντος δὲ Κάλχαντος Ἕλενον εἰδέναι τοὺς ῥυομένους τὴν πόλιν χρησμούς, ἐνεδρεύσας αὐτὸν Ὀδυσσεὺς καὶ χειρωσάμενος ἐπὶ τὸ στρατόπεδον ἤγαγε:

[9] After the death of Alexander, Helenus and Deiphobus quarrelled as to which of them should marry Helen; and as Deiphobus was preferred, Helenus left Troy and abode in Ida. But as Chalcas said that Helenus knew the oracles that protected the city, Ulysses waylaid and captured him and brought him to the camp;

[10] καὶ ἀναγκαζόμενος ὁ Ἕλενος λέγει πῶς ἂν αἱρεθείη ἡ Ἴλιος, πρῶτον μὲν εἰ τὰ Πέλοπος ὀστᾶ κομισθείη παρ᾽ αὐτούς, ἔπειτα εἰ Νεοπτόλεμος συμμαχοίη, τρίτον εἰ τὸ διιπετὲς παλλάδιον ἐκκλαπείη: τούτου γὰρ ἔνδον ὄντος οὐ δύνασθαι τὴν πόλιν ἁλῶναι.

[10] and Helenus was forced to tell how Ilium could be taken, to wit, first, if the bones of Pelops were brought to them; next, if Neoptolemus fought for them; and third, if the Palladium, which had fallen from heaven, were stolen from Troy, for while it was within the walls the city could not be taken.

[11] ταῦτα ἀκούσαντες Ἕλληνες τὰ μὲν Πέλοπος ὀστᾶ μετακομίζουσιν, Ὀδυσσέα δὲ καὶ Φοίνικα πρὸς Λυκομήδην πέμπουσιν εἰς Σκῦρον, οἱ δὲ πείθουσι αὐτὸν Νεοπτόλεμον προέσθαι. παραγενόμενος δὲ οὗτος εἰς τὸ στρατόπεδον καὶ λαβὼν παρ᾽ ἑκόντος Ὀδυσσέως τὴν τοῦ πατρὸς πανοπλίαν πολλοὺς τῶν Τρώων ἀναιρεῖ.

[11] On hearing these things the Greeks caused the bones of Pelops to be fetched, and they sent Ulysses and Phoenix to Lycomedes at Scyros, and these two persuaded him to let Neoptolemus go. On coming to the camp and receiving his father’s arms from Ulysses, who willingly resigned them, Neoptolemus slew many of the Trojans.

[12] ἀφικνεῖται δὲ ὕστερον Τρωσὶ σύμμαχος Εὐρύπυλος ὁ Τηλέφου πολλὴν Μυσῶν δύναμιν ἄγων: τοῦτον ἀριστεύσαντα Νεοπτόλεμος ἀπέκτεινεν.

[12] Afterwards, Eurypylus, son of Telephus, arrived to fight for the Trojans, bringing a great force of Mysians. He performed doughty deeds, but was slain by Neoptolemus.

[13] Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ μετὰ Διομήδους παραγενόμενος νύκτωρ εἰς τὴν πόλιν Διομήδην μὲν αὐτοῦ μένειν εἴα, αὐτὸς δὲ ἑαυτὸν αἰκισάμενος καὶ πενιχρὰν στολὴν ἐνδυσάμενος ἀγνώστως εἰς τὴν πόλιν εἰσέρχεται ὡς ἐπαίτης: γνωρισθεὶς δὲ ὑπὸ Ἑλένης δι᾽ ἐκείνης τὸ παλλάδιον ἔκλεψε καὶ πολλοὺς κτείνας τῶν φυλασσόντων ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς μετὰ Διομήδους κομίζει.

[13] And Ulysses went with Diomedes by night to the city, and there he let Diomedes wait, and after disfiguring himself and putting on mean attire he entered unknown into the city as a beggar. And being recognized by Helen, he with her help stole away the Palladium, and after killing many of the guards, brought it to the ships with the aid of Diomedes.

[14] ὕστερον δὲ ἐπινοεῖ δουρείου ἵππου κατασκευὴν καὶ ὑποτίθεται Ἐπειῷ, ὃς ἦν ἀρχιτέκτων: οὗτος ἀπὸ τῆς Ἴδης ξύλα τεμὼν ἵππον κατασκευάζει κοῖλον ἔνδοθεν εἰς τὰς πλευρὰς ἀνεῳγμένον. εἰς τοῦτον Ὀδυσσεὺς εἰσελθεῖν πείθει πεντήκοντα τοὺς ἀρίστους, ὡς δὲ ὁ τὴν μικρὰν γράψας Ἰλιάδα φησί, τρισχιλίους, τοὺς δὲ λοιποὺς γενομένης νυκτὸς ἐμπρήσαντας τὰς σκηνάς, ἀναχθέντας περὶ τὴν Τένεδον ναυλοχεῖν καὶ μετὰ τὴν ἐπιοῦσαν νύκτα καταπλεῖν.

[14] But afterwards he invented the construction of the Wooden Horse and suggested it to Epeus, who was an architect. Epeus felled timber on Ida, and constructed the horse with a hollow interior and an opening in the sides. Into this horse Ulysses persuaded fifty （ or, according to the author of the Little Iliad, three thousand） of the doughtiest to enter, while the rest, when night had fallen, were to burn their tents, and, putting to sea, to lie to off Tenedos, but to sail back to land after the ensuing night.

[15] οἱ δὲ πείθονται καὶ τοὺς μὲν ἀρίστους ἐμβιβάζουσιν εἰς τὸν ἵππον, ἡγεμόνα καταστήσαντες αὐτῶν Ὀδυσσέα, γράμματα ἐγχαράξαντες τὰ δηλοῦντα: τῆς εἰς οἶκον ἀνακομιδῆς Ἕλληνες Ἀθηνᾷ χαριστήριον. αὐτοὶ δὲ ἐμπρήσαντες τὰς σκηνὰς καὶ καταλιπόντες Σίνωνα, ὃς ἔμελλεν αὐτοῖς πυρσὸν ἀνάπτειν, τῆς νυκτὸς ἀνάγονται καὶ περὶ Τένεδον ναυλοχοῦσιν.

[15] They followed the advice of Ulysses and introduced the doughtiest into the horse, after appointing Ulysses their leader and engraving on the horse an inscription which signified, “ For their return home, the Greeks dedicate this thank — offering to Athena.” But they themselves burned their tents, and leaving Sinon, who was to light a beacon as a signal to them, they put to sea by night, and lay to off Tenedos.

[16] ἡμέρας δὲ γενομένης ἔρημον οἱ Τρῶες τὸ τῶν Ἑλλήνων στρατόπεδον θεασάμενοι καὶ νομίσαντες αὐτοὺς πεφευγέναι, περιχαρέντες εἷλκον τὸν ἵππον καὶ παρὰ τοῖς Πριάμου βασιλείοις στήσαντες ἐβουλεύοντο τί χρὴ ποιεῖν.

[16] And at break of day, when the Trojans beheld the camp of the Greeks deserted and believed that they had fled, they with great joy dragged the horse, and stationing it beside the palace of Priam deliberated what they should do.

[17] Κασάνδρας δὲ λεγούσης ἔνοπλον ἐν αὐτῷ δύναμιν εἶναι, καὶ προσέτι Λαοκόωντος τοῦ μάντεως, τοῖς μὲν ἐδόκει κατακαίειν, τοῖς δὲ κατὰ βαράθρων ἀφιέναι: δόξαν δὲ τοῖς πολλοῖς ἵνα αὐτὸν ἐάσωσι θεῖον ἀνάθημα, τραπέντες ἐπὶ θυσίαν εὐωχοῦντο.

[17] As Cassandra said that there was an armed force in it, and she was further confirmed by Laocoon, the seer, some were for burning it, and others for throwing it down a precipice; but as most were in favour of sparing it as a votive offering sacred to a divinity, they betook them to sacrifice and feasting.

[18] Ἀπόλλων δὲ αὐτοῖς σημεῖον ἐπιπέμπει: δύο γὰρ δράκοντες διανηξάμενοι διὰ τῆς θαλάσσης ἐκ τῶν πλησίον νήσων τοὺς Λαοκόωντος υἱοὺς κατεσθίουσιν.

[18] However, Apollo sent them a sign; for two serpents swam through the sea from the neighboring islands and devoured the sons of Laocoon.

[19] ὡς δὲ ἐγένετο νὺξ καὶ πάντας ὕπνος κατεῖχεν, οἱ ἀπὸ Τενέδου προσέπλεον, καὶ Σίνων αὐτοῖς ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἀχιλλέως τάφου πυρσὸν ἧπτεν. Ἑλένη δὲ ἐλθοῦσα περὶ τὸν ἵππον, μιμουμένη τὰς φωνὰς ἑκάστης τῶν γυναικῶν, τοὺς ἀριστέας ἐκάλει. ὑπακοῦσαι δὲ Ἀντίκλου θέλοντος Ὀδυσσεὺς τὸ στόμα κατέσχεν.

[19] And when night fell, and all were plunged in sleep, the Greeks drew near by sea from Tenedos, and Sinon kindled the beacon on the grave of Achilles to guide them. And Helen, going round the horse, called the chiefs, imitating the voices of each of their wives. But when Anticlus would have answered, Ulysses held fast his mouth.

[20] ὡς δ᾽ ἐνόμισαν κοιμᾶσθαι τοὺς πολεμίους, ἀνοίξαντες σὺν τοῖς ὅπλοις ἐξῄεσαν: καὶ πρῶτος μὲν Ἐχίων Πορθέως ἀφαλλόμενος ἀπέθανεν, οἱ δὲ λοιποὶ σειρᾷ ἐξάψαντες ἑαυτοὺς ἐπὶ τὰ τείχη παρεγένοντο καὶ τὰς πύλας ἀνοίξαντες ὑπεδέξαντο τοὺς ἀπὸ Τενέδου καταπλεύσαντας.

[20] and when they thought that their foes were asleep, they opened the horse and came forth with their arms. The first, Echion, son of Portheus, was killed by leaping from it; but the rest let themselves down by a rope, and lighted on the walls, and having opened the gates they admitted their comrades who had landed from Tenedos.

[21] χωρήσαντες δὲ μεθ᾽ ὅπλων εἰς τὴν πόλιν, εἰς τὰς οἰκίας ἐπερχόμενοι κοιμωμένους ἀνῄρουν. καὶ Νεοπτόλεμος μὲν ἐπὶ τοῦ ἑρκείου Διὸς βωμοῦ καταφεύγοντα Πρίαμον ἀνεῖλεν:Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ καὶ Μενέλαος Γλαῦκον τὸν Ἀντήνορος εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν φεύγοντα γνωρίσαντες μεθ᾽ ὅπλων ἐλθόντες ἔσωσαν. Αἰνείας δὲ Ἀγχίσην τὸν πατέρα βαστάσας ἔφυγεν, οἱ δὲ Ἕλληνες αὐτὸν διὰ τὴν εὐσέβειαν εἴασαν.

[21] And marching, arms in hand, into the city, they entered the houses and slew the sleepers. Neoptolemus slew Priam, who had taken refuge at the altar of Zeus of the Courtyard. But when Glaucus, son of Antenor, fled to his house, Ulysses and Menelaus recognized and rescued him by their armed intervention. Aeneas took up his father Anchises and fled, and the Greeks let him alone on account of his piety.

[22] Μενέλαος δὲ Δηίφοβον κτείνας Ἑλένην ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς ἄγει: ἀπάγουσι δὲ καὶ τὴν Θησέως μητέρα Αἴθραν οἱ Θησέως παῖδεσΔημοφῶν καὶ Ἀκάμας: καὶ γὰρ τούτους λέγουσιν εἰς Τροίαν ἐλθεῖν ὕστερον. Αἴας δὲ ὁ Λοκρὸς Κασάνδραν ὁρῶν περιπεπλεγμένην τῷ ξοάνῳ τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς βιάζεται: διὰ τοῦτο τὸ ξόανον εἰς οὐρανὸν βλέπειν.

[22] But Menelaus slew Deiphobus and led away Helen to the ships; and Aethra, mother of Theseus, was also led away by Demophon and Acamas, the sons of Theseus; for they say that they afterwards went to Troy. And the Locrian Ajax, seeing Cassandra clinging to the wooden image of Athena, violated her; therefore they say that the image looks to heaven.

[23] κτείναντες δὲ τοὺς Τρῶας τὴν πόλιν ἐνέπρησαν καὶ τὰ λάφυρα ἐμερίσαντο. καὶ θύσαντες πᾶσι τοῖς θεοῖς Ἀστυάνακτα ἀπὸ τῶν πύργων ἔρριψαν, Πολυξένην δὲ ἐπὶ τῷ Ἀχιλλέως τάφῳ κατέσφαξαν. λαμβάνει δὲ Ἀγαμέμνων μὲν κατ᾽ ἐξαίρετον Κασάνδραν, Νεοπτόλεμος δὲ Ἀνδρομάχην, Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ Ἑκάβην. ὡς δὲ ἔνιοι λέγουσιν, Ἕλενος αὐτὴν λαμβάνει, καὶ διακομισθεὶς εἰς Χερρόνησον σὺν αὐτῇ κύνα γενομένην θάπτει, ἔνθα νῦν λέγεται Κυνὸς σῆμα. Λαοδίκην μὲν γὰρ κάλλει τῶν Πριάμου θυγατέρων διαφέρουσαν βλεπόντων πάντων γῆ χάσματι ἀπέκρυψεν.ὡς δὲ ἔμελλον ἀποπλεῖν πορθήσαντες Τροίαν, ὑπὸ Κάλχαντος κατείχοντο, μηνίειν Ἀθηνᾶν αὐτοῖς λέγοντος διὰ τὴν Αἴαντος ἀσέβειαν.καὶ τὸν μὲν Αἴαντα κτείνειν ἔμελλον, φεύγοντα δὲ ἐπὶ βωμὸν εἴασαν.

[23] And having slain the Trojans, they set fire to the city and divided the spoil among them. And having sacrificed to all the gods, they threw Astyanax from the battlements and slaughtered Polyxena on the grave of Achilles. And as special awards Agamemnon got Cassandra, Neoptolemus got Andromache, and Ulysses got Hecuba. But some say that Helenus got her, and crossed over with her to the Chersonese; and that there she turned into a bitch, and he buried her at the place now called the Bitch’s Tomb. As for Laodice, the fairest of the daughters of Priam, she was swallowed up by a chasm in the earth in the sight of all. When they had laid Troy waste and were about to sail away, they were detained by Calchas, who said that Athena was angry with them on account of the impiety of Ajax. And they would have killed Ajax, but he fled to the altar and they let him alone.

[1] καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα συνελθόντων εἰς ἐκκλησίαν, Ἀγαμέμνων καὶ Μενέλαος ἐφιλονείκουν, Μενελάου λέγοντος ἀποπλεῖν, Ἀγαμέμνονος δὲ ἐπιμένειν κελεύοντος καὶ θύειν Ἀθηνᾷ.ἀναχθέντες δὲ Διομήδης καὶ Νέστωρ καὶ Μενέλαος ἅμα, οἱ μὲν εὐπλοοῦσιν, ὁ δὲ Μενέλαος χειμῶνι περιπεσών, τῶν λοιπῶν ἀπολομένων σκαφῶν, πέντε ναυσὶν ἐπ᾽ Αἴγυπτον ἀφικνεῖται.

[1] After these things they met in assembly, and Agamemnon and Menelaus quarrelled, Menelaus advising that they should sail away, and Agamemnon insisting that they should stay and sacrifice to Athena. When they put to sea, Diomedes, Nestor, and Menelaus in company, the two former had a prosperous voyage, but Menelaus was overtaken by a storm, and after losing the rest of his vessels, arrived with five ships in Egypt.

[2] Ἀμφίλοχος δὲ καὶ Κάλχας καὶ Λεοντεὺς καὶ Ποδαλείριος καὶ Πολυποίτης ἐν Ἰλίῳ τὰς ναῦς ἀπολιπόντες ἐπὶ Κολοφῶνα πεζῇ πορεύονται, κἀκεῖ θάπτουσι Κάλχαντα τὸν μάντιν: ἦν γὰρ αὐτῷ λόγιον τελευτήσειν, ἐὰν ἑαυτοῦ σοφωτέρῳ περιτύχῃ μάντει.

[2] But Amphilochus, and Calchas, and Leonteus, and Podalirius, and Polypoetes left their ships in Ilium and journeyed by land to Colophon, and there buried Calchas the diviner; for it was foretold him that he would die if he met with a wiser diviner than himself.

[3] ὑποδεχθέντων οὖν ὑπὸ Μόψου μάντεως, ὃς Ἀπόλλωνος καὶ Μαντοῦς παῖς ὑπῆρχεν, οὗτος ὁ Μόψος περὶ μαντικῆς ἤρισε Κάλχαντι. καὶ Κάλχαντος ἀνακρίναντος ἐρινεοῦ ἑστώσης ‘πόσους ὀλύνθους φέρει;’ ὁ Μόψος: ‘μυρίους’ ἔφη ‘καὶ μέδιμνον καὶ ἕνα ὄλυνθον περισσόν:’

[3] Well, they were lodged by the diviner Mopsus, who was a son of Apollo and Manto, and he wrangled with Calchas about the art of divination. A wild fig-tree grew on the spot, and when Calchas asked, “ How many figs does it bear?” Mopsus answered, “ Ten thousand, and a bushel, and one fig over,” and they were found to be so.

[4] καὶ εὑρέθησαν οὕτω. Μόψος δὲ συὸς οὔσης ἐπιτόκου ἠρώτα Κάλχαντα, πόσους χοίρους κατὰ γαστρὸς ἔχει καὶ πότε τέκοι:τοῦ δὲ εἰπόντος: ‘ὀκτώ,’ μειδιάσας ὁ Μόψος ἔφη: ‘Κάλχας τῆς ἀκριβοῦς μαντείας ἀπεναντιῶς διακεῖται, ἐγὼ δ᾽ Ἀπόλλωνος καὶ Μαντοῦς παῖς ὑπάρχων τῆς ἀκριβοῦς μαντείας τὴν ὀξυδορκίαν πάντως πλουτῶ, καὶ οὐχ ὡς ὁ Κάλχας ὀκτώ, ἀλλ᾽ ἐννέα κατὰ γαστρός, καὶ τούτους ἄρρενας ὅλους ἔχειν μαντεύομαι, καὶ αὔριον ἀνυπερθέτως ἐν ἕκτῃ ὥρᾳ τεχθήσεσθαι.’ὧν γενομένων Κάλχας ἀθυμήσας ἀπέθανεκαὶ ἐτάφη ἐν Νοτίῳ.

[4] And when Mopsus asked Calchas concerning a pregnant sow, “ How many pigs has she in her womb, and when will she farrow?” Calchas answered, “ Eight.” But Mopsus smiled and said,” The divination of Calchas is the reverse of exact; but I, as a son of Apollo and Manto, am extremely rich in the sharp sight which comes of exact divination, and I divine that the number of pigs in the womb is not eight, as Calchas says, but nine, and that they are all male and will be farrowed without fail tomorrow at the sixth hour.” So when these things turned out so, Calchas died of a broken heart and was buried at Notium.

[5] Ἀγαμέμνων δὲ θύσας ἀνάγεται καὶ Τενέδῳ προσίσχει, Νεοπτόλεμον δὲ πείθει Θέτις ἀφικομένη ἐπιμεῖναι δύο ἡμέρας καὶ θυσιάσαι, καὶ ἐπιμένει. οἱ δὲ ἀνάγονται καὶ περὶ Τῆνον χειμάζονται. Ἀθηνᾶ γὰρ ἐδεήθη Διὸς τοῖς Ἕλλησι χειμῶνα ἐπιπέμψαι. καὶ πολλαὶ νῆες βυθίζονται.

[5] After sacrificing, Agamemnon put to sea and touched at Tenedos. But Thetis came and persuaded Neoptolemus to wait two days and to offer sacrifice; and he waited. But the others put to sea and encountered a storm at Tenos; for Athena entreated Zeus to send a tempest against the Greeks; and many ships foundered.

[6] Ἀθηνᾶ δὲ ἐπὶ τὴν Αἴαντος ναῦν κεραυνὸν βάλλει, ὁ δὲ τῆς νεὼς διαλυθείσης ἐπί τινα πέτραν διασωθεὶς παρὰ τὴν θεοῦ ἔφη πρόνοιαν σεσῶσθαι. Ποσειδῶν δὲ πλήξας τῇ τριαίνῃ τὴν πέτραν ἔσχισεν, ὁ δὲ πεσὼν εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν τελευτᾷ, καὶ ἐκβρασθέντα θάπτει Θέτις ἐν Μυκόνῳ.

[6] And Athena threw a thunderbolt at the ship of Ajax; and when the ship went to pieces he made his way safe to a rock, and declared that he was saved in spite of the intention of Athena. But Poseidon smote the rock with his trident and split it, and Ajax fell into the sea and perished; and his body, being washed up, was buried by Thetis in Myconos.

[7] τῶν δὲ ἄλλων Εὐβοίᾳ προσφερομένων νυκτὸς Ναύπλιος ἐπὶ τοῦ Καφηρέως ὄρους πυρσὸν ἀνάπτει: οἱ δὲ νομίσαντες εἶναί τινας τῶν σεσωσμένων προσπλέουσι, καὶ περὶ τὰς Καφηρίδας πέτρας θραύεται τὰ σκάφη καὶ πολλοὶ τελευτῶσιν.

[7] The others being driven to Euboea by night, Nauplius kindled a beacon on Mount Caphareus; and they, thinking it was some of those who were saved, stood in for the shore, and the vessels were wrecked on the Capherian rocks, and many men perished.

[8] ὁ γὰρ τοῦ Ναυπλίου καὶ Κλυμένης τῆς Κατρέως υἱὸς Παλαμήδης ἐπιβουλαῖς Ὀδυσσέως λιθοβοληθεὶς ἀναιρεῖται. τοῦτο μαθὼν Ναύπλιος ἔπλευσε πρὸς τοὺς Ἕλληνας καὶ τὴν τοῦ παιδὸς ἀπῄτει ποινήν:

[8] For Palamedes, the son of Nauplius and Clymene daughter of Catreus, had been stoned to death through the machinations of Ulysses. And when Nauplius learned of it, he sailed to the Greeks and claimed satisfaction for the death of his son;

[9] ἄπρακτος δὲ ὑποστρέψας, ὡς πάντων χαριζομένων τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἀγαμέμνονι, μεθ᾽ οὗ τὸν Παλαμήδην ἀνεῖλεν Ὀδυσσεύς, παραπλέων τὰς χώρας τὰς Ἑλληνίδας παρεσκεύασε τὰς τῶν Ἑλλήνων γυναῖκας μοιχευθῆναι, Κλυταιμνήστραν Αἰγίσθῳ, Αἰγιάλειαν τῷ Σθενέλου Κομήτῃ, τὴν Ἰδομενέως Μήδαν ὑπὸ Λεύκου:

[9] but when he returned unsuccessful （ for they all favoured King Agamemnon, who had been the accomplice of Ulysses in the murder of Palamedes）, he coasted along the Grecian lands and contrived that the wives of the Greeks should play their husbands false, Clytaemnestra with Aegisthus, Aegialia with Cometes, son of Sthenelus, and Meda, wife of Idomeneus, with Leucus.

[10] ἣν καὶ ἀνεῖλε Λεῦκος ἅμα Κλεισιθύρᾳ τῇ θυγατρὶ ταύτης ἐν τῷ ναῷ προσφυγούσῃ, καὶ δέκα πόλεις ἀποσπάσας τῆς Κρήτης ἐτυράννησε: καὶ μετὰ τὸν Τρωικὸν πόλεμον καὶ τὸν Ἰδομενέα κατάραντα τῇ Κρήτῃ ἐξήλασε.

[10] But Leucus killed her, together with her daughter Clisithyra, who had taken refuge in the temple; and having detached ten cities from Crete he made himself tyrant of them; and when after the Trojan war Idomeneus landed in Crete, Leucus drove him out.

[11] ταῦτα πρότερον κατασκευάσας ὁ Ναύπλιος, ὕστερον μαθὼν τὴν εἰς τὰς πατρίδας τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἐπάνοδον, τὸν εἰς τὸν Καφηρέα, νῦν δὲ Ξυλοφάγον λεγόμενον, ἀνῆψε φρυκτόν: ἔνθα προσπελάσαντες Ἕλληνες ἐν τῷ δοκεῖν λιμένα εἶναι διεφθάρησαν.

[11] These were the earlier contrivances of Nauplius; but afterwards, when he learned that the Greeks were on their way home to their native countries, he kindled the beacon fire on Mount Caphereus, which is now called Xylophagus; and there the Greeks, standing in shore in the belief that it was a harbor, were cast away.

[12] Νεοπτόλεμος δὲ μείνας ἐν Τενέδῳ δύο ἡμέρας ὑποθήκαις τῆς Θέτιδος εἰς Μολοσσοὺς πεζῇ ἀπῄει μετὰ Ἑλένου, καὶ παρὰ τὴν ὁδὸν ἀποθανόντα Φοίνικα θάπτει, καὶ νικήσας μάχῃ Μολοσσοὺς βασιλεύει, καὶ ἐξ Ἀνδρομάχης γεννᾷ Μολοσσόν.

[12] After remaining in Tenedos two days at the advice of Thetis, Neoptolemus set out for the country of the Molossians by land with Helenus, and on the way Phoenix died, and Neoptolemus buried him; and having vanquished the Molossians in battle he reigned as king and begat Molossus on Andromache. And

[13] Ἕλενος δὲ κτίσας ἐν τῇ Μολοσσίᾳ πόλιν κατοικεῖ, καὶ δίδωσιν αὐτῷ Νεοπτόλεμος εἰς γυναῖκα τὴν μητέρα Δηιδάμειαν. Πηλέως δὲ ἐκ Φθίας ἐκβληθέντος ὑπὸ τῶν Ἀκάστου παίδων καὶ ἀποθανόντος, Νεοπτόλεμος τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ πατρὸς παρέλαβε.

[13] Helenus founded a city in Molossia and inhabited it, and Neoptolemus gave him his mother Deidamia to wife. And when Peleus was expelled from Phthia by the sons of Acastus and died, Neoptolemus succeeded to his father’s kingdom.

[14] καὶ μανέντος Ὀρέστου ἁρπάζει τὴν ἐκείνου γυναῖκα Ἑρμιόνην κατηγγυημένην αὐτῷ πρότερον ἐν Τροίᾳ, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ἐν Δελφοῖς ὑπὸ Ὀρέστου κτείνεται. ἔνιοι δὲ αὐτόν φασι παραγενόμενον εἰς Δελφοὺς ἀπαιτεῖν ὑπὲρ τοῦ πατρὸς τὸν Ἀπόλλωνα δίκας καὶ συλᾶν τὰ ἀναθήματα καὶ τὸν νεὼν ἐμπιμπράναι, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ὑπὸ Μαχαιρέως τοῦ Φωκέως ἀναιρεθῆναι.

[14] And when Orestes went mad, Neoptolemus carried off his wife Hermione, who had previously been betrothed to him in Troy; and for that reason he was slain by Orestes at Delphi. But some say that he went to Delphi to demand satisfaction from Apollo for the death of his father, and that he rifled the votive offerings and set fire to the temple, and was on that account slain by Machaereus the Phocian.

[15] ὅτι πλανηθέντες Ἕλληνες ἄλλοι ἀλλαχοῦ κατάραντες κατοικοῦσιν, οἱ μὲν εἰς Λιβύην, οἱ δὲ εἰς Ἰταλίαν, εἰς Σικελίαν ἕτεροι, τινὲς δὲ πρὸς τὰς πλησίον Ἰβηρίας νήσους, ἄλλοι παρὰ τὸν Σαγγάριον ποταμόν: εἰσὶ δὲ οἳ καὶ Κύπρον ᾤκησαν.τῶν δὲ ναυαγησάντων περὶ τὸν Καφηρέα ἄλλος ἀλλαχῆ φέρεται, Γουνεὺς μὲν εἰς Λιβύην, Ἄντιφος δὲ ὁ Θεσσαλοῦ εἰς Πελασγοὺς καὶ τὴν χώραν κατασχὼν Θεσσαλίαν ἐκάλεσεν, ὁ δὲ Φιλοκτήτης πρὸς Ἰταλίαν εἰς Καμπανούς, Φείδιππος μετὰ τῶν Κῴων ἐν Ἄνδρῳ κατῴκησεν, Ἀγαπήνωρ ἐν Κύπρῳ, καὶ ἄλλος ἀλλαχοῦ. [15α] “Ἀπολλόδωρος δὲ καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ οὕτω φασί: Γουνεὺς εἰς Λιβύην λιπὼν τὰς ἑαυτοῦ ναῦς ἐλθὼν ἐπὶ Κίνυφα ποταμὸν κατοικεῖ. Μέγης δὲ καὶ Πρόθοος ἐν Εὐβοίᾳ περὶ τὸν Καφηρέα σὺν πολλοῖς ἑτέροις διαφθείρεται ... τοῦ δὲ Προθόου περὶ τὸν Καφηρέα ναυαγήσαντος, οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ Μάγνητες εἰς Κρήτην ῥιφέντες ᾤκησαν. “ Tzetzes, Scholia on Lycophron, 902[15β] “μετὰ δὲ τὴν Ἰλίου πόρθησιν Μενεσθεὺς Φείδιππός τε καὶ Ἄντιφος καὶ οἱ Ἐλεφήνορος καὶ Φιλοκτήτης μέχρι Μίμαντος κοινῇ ἔπλευσαν. εἶτα Μενεσθεὺς μὲν εἰς Μῆλον ἐλθὼν βασιλεύει, τοῦ ἐκεῖ βασιλέως Πολυάνακτος τελευτήσαντος. Ἄντιφος δὲ ὁ Θεσσαλοῦ εἰς Πελασγοὺς ἐλθὼν καὶ τὴν χώραν κατασχὼν Θεσσαλίαν ἐκάλεσε. Φείδιππος δὲ μετὰ Κῴων ἐξωσθεὶς περὶ τὴν Ἄνδρον, εἶτα περὶ Κύπρον ἐκεῖ κατῴκησεν.

[15] After their wanderings the Greeks landed and settled in various countries, some in Libya, some in Italy, others in Sicily, and some in the islands near Iberia, others on the banks of the Sangarius river; and some settled also in Cyprus. And of those that were shipwrecked at Caphereus, some drifted one way and some another. Guneus went to Libya; Antiphus, son of Thessalus, went to the Pelasgians, and, having taken possession of the country, called it Thessaly. Philoctetes went to the Campanians in Italy; Phidippus with the Coans settled in Andros, Agapenor in Cyprus, and others elsewhere. [15a]” Apollodorus and the rest say as follows. Guneus left his own ships, and having come to the Cinyps river in Libya he dwelt there. But Meges and Prothous, with many others, were cast away at Caphereus in Euboea... and when Prothous was shipwrecked at Caphereus, the Magnesians with him drifted to Crete and settled there.”Tzetzes, Scholia on Lycophron, 902[15b]” After the sack of Ilium, Menestheus, Phidippus and Antiphus, and the people of Elephenor, and Philoctetes sailed together as far as Mimas. Then Menestheus went to Melos and reigned as king, because the king there, Polyanax, had died. And Antiphus the son of Thessalus went to the Pelasgians, and having taken possession of the country he called it Thessaly. Phidippus with the Coans was driven first to Andros, and then to Cyprus, where he settled. Elephenor died in Troy, but his people were cast away in the Ionian gulf and inhabited Apollonia in Epirus. And the people of Tlepolemus touched at Crete; then they were driven out of their course by winds and settled in the Iberian islands. ...The people of Protesilaus were cast away on Pellene near the plain of Canastrum. And Philoctetes was driven to Campania in Italy, and after making war on the Lucanians, he settled in Crimissa, near Croton and Thurium; and, his wanderings over, he founded a sanctuary of Apollo the Wanderer （Alaios）, to whom also he dedicated his bow, as Euphorion says.”Tzetzes, Scholia on Lycophron, 911[15c]” Navaethus is a river of Italy. It was called so, according to Apollodorus and the rest, because after the capture of Ilium the daughters of Laomedon, the sisters of Priam, to wit, Aethylla, Astyoche, and Medesicaste, with the other female captives, finding themselves in that part of Italy, and dreading slavery in Greece, set fire to the vessels; whence the river was called Navaethus and the women were called Nauprestides; and the Greeks who were with the women, having lost the vessels, settled there.”Tzetzes, Scholia on Lycophron, 921

[16] Δημοφῶν δὲ Θρᾳξὶ Βισάλταις μετ᾽ ὀλίγων νεῶν προσίσχει, καὶ αὐτοῦ ἐρασθεῖσα Φυλλὶς ἡ θυγάτηρ τοῦ βασιλέως ἐπὶ προικὶ τῇ βασιλείᾳ συνευνάζεται ὑπὸ τοῦ πατρός. ὁ δὲ βουλόμενος εἰς τὴν πατρίδα ἀπιέναι, πολλὰ δεηθεὶς ὀμόσας ἀναστρέψειν ἀπέρχεται: καὶ Φυλλὶς αὐτὸν ἄχρι τῶν Ἐννέα ὁδῶν λεγομένων προπέμπει καὶ δίδωσιν αὐτῷ κίστην, εἰποῦσα ἱερὸν τῆς μητρὸς Ῥέας ἐνεῖναι, καὶ ταύτην μὴ ἀνοίγειν, εἰ μὴ ὅταν ἀπελπίσῃ τῆς πρὸς αὐτὴν ἀνόδου.

[16] Demophon with a few ships put in to the land of the Thracian Bisaltians, and there Phyllis, the king’s daughter, falling in love with him, was given him in marriage by her father with the kingdom for her dower. But he wished to depart to his own country, and after many entreaties and swearing to return, he did depart. And Phyllis accompanied him as far as what are called the Nine Roads, and she gave him a casket, telling him that it contained a sacrament of Mother Rhea, and that he was not to open it until he should have abandoned all hope of returning to her.

[17] Δημοφῶν δὲ ἐλθὼν εἰς Κύπρον ἐκεῖ κατῴκει. καὶ τοῦ τακτοῦ χρόνου διελθόντος Φυλλὶς ἀρὰς θεμένη κατὰ Δημοφῶντος ἑαυτὴν ἀναιρεῖ: Δημοφῶν δὲ τὴν κίστην ἀνοίξας φόβῳ κατασχεθεὶς ἄνεισιν ἐπὶ τὸν ἵππον καὶ τοῦτον ἐλαύνων ἀτάκτως ἀπόλλυται: τοῦ γὰρ ἵππου σφαλέντος κατενεχθεὶς ἐπὶ τὸ ξίφος ἔπεσεν. οἱ δὲ σὺν αὐτῷ κατῴκησαν ἐν Κύπρῳ.

[17] And Demophon went to Cyprus and dwelt there. And when the appointed time was past, Phyllis called down curses on Demophon and killed herself; and Demophon opened the casket, and, being struck with fear, he mounted his horse and galloping wildly met his end; for, the horse stumbling, he was thrown and fell on his sword. But his people settled in Cyprus.

[18] Ποδαλείριος δὲ ἀφικόμενος εἰς Δελφοὺς ἐχρᾶτο ποῦ κατοικήσει: χρησμοῦ δὲ δοθέντος, εἰς ἣν πόλιν τοῦ περιέχοντος οὐρανοῦ πεσόντος οὐδὲν πείσεται, τῆς Καρικῆς Χερρονήσου τὸν πέριξ οὐρανοῦ κυκλούμενον ὄρεσι τόπον κατῴκησεν.

[18] Podalirius went to Delphi and inquired of the oracle where he should settle; and on receiving an oracle that he should settle in the city where, if the encompassing heaven were to fall, he would suffer no harm, he settled in that place of the Carian Chersonnese which is encircled by mountains all round the horizon.

[19] Ἀμφίλοχος δὲ ὁ Ἀλκμαίωνος, κατά τινας ὕστερον παραγενόμενος εἰς Τροίαν, κατὰ τὸν χειμῶνα ἀπερρίφη πρὸς Μόψον, καί, ὥς τινες λέγουσιν, ὑπὲρ τῆς βασιλείας μονομαχοῦντες ἔκτειναν ἀλλήλους.

[19] Amphilochus son of Alcmaeon, who, according to some, arrived later at Troy, was driven in the storm to the home of Mopsus; and, as some say, they fought a single combat for the kingdom, and slew each other.

[20] Λοκροὶ δὲ μόλις τὴν ἑαυτῶν καταλαβόντες, ἐπεὶ μετὰ τρίτον ἔτος τὴν Λοκρίδα κατέσχε φθορά, δέχονται χρησμὸν ἐξιλάσασθαι τὴν ἐν Ἰλίῳ Ἀθηνᾶν καὶ δύο παρθένους πέμπειν ἱκέτιδας ἐπὶ ἔτη χίλια. καὶ λαγχάνουσι πρῶται Περίβοια καὶ Κλεοπάτρα.

[20] The Locrians regained their own country with difficulty, and three years afterwards, when Locris was visited by a plague, they received an oracle bidding them to propitiate Athena at Ilium and to send two maidens as suppliants for a thousand years. The lot first fell on Periboea and Cleopatra.

[21] αὗται δὲ εἰς Τροίαν ἀφικόμεναι, διωκόμεναι παρὰ τῶν ἐγχωρίων εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν κατέρχονται: καὶ τῇ μὲν θεᾷ οὐ προσήρχοντο, τὸ δὲ ἱερὸν ἔσαιρόν τε καὶ ἔρραινον: ἐκτὸς δὲ τοῦ νεὼ οὐκ ἐξῄεσαν, κεκαρμέναι δὲ ἦσαν καὶ μονοχίτωνες καὶ ἀνυπόδετοι.

[21] And when they came to Troy they were chased by the natives and took refuge in the sanctuary. And they did not approach the goddess, but swept and sprinkled the sanctuary; and they did not go out of the temple, and their hair was cropped, and they wore single garments and no shoes.

[22] τῶν δὲ πρώτων ἀποθανουσῶν ἄλλας ἔπεμπον: εἰσῄεσαν δὲ εἰς τὴν πόλιν νύκτωρ, ἵνα μὴ φανεῖσαι τοῦ τεμένους ἔξω φονευθῶσι: μετέπειτα δὲ βρέφη μετὰ τροφῶν ἔπεμπον. χιλίων δὲ ἐτῶν παρελθόντων μετὰ τὸν Φωκικὸν πόλεμον ἱκέτιδας ἐπαύσαντο πέμποντες.

[22] And when the first maidens died, they sent others; and they entered into the city by night, lest, being seen outside the precinct, they should be put to the sword; but afterwards they sent babes with their nurses. And when the thousand years were passed, after the Phocian war they ceased to send suppliants.

[23] Ἀγαμέμνων δὲ καταντήσας εἰς Μυκήνας μετὰ Κασάνδρας ἀναιρεῖται ὑπὸ Αἰγίσθου καὶ Κλυταιμνήστρας: δίδωσι γὰρ αὐτῷ χιτῶνα ἄχειρα καὶ ἀτράχηλον, καὶ τοῦτον ἐνδυόμενος φονεύεται, καὶ βασιλεύει Μυκηνῶν Αἴγισθος: κτείνουσι δὲ καὶ Κασάνδραν.

[23] After Agamemnon had returned to Mycenae with Cassandra, he was murdered by Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra; for she gave him a shirt without sleeves and without a neck, and while he was putting it on he was cut down, and Aegisthus reigned over Mycenae. And they killed Cassandra also.

[24] Ἠλέκτρα δὲ μία τῶν Ἀγαμέμνονος θυγατέρων Ὀρέστην τὸν ἀδελφὸν ἐκκλέπτει καὶ δίδωσι Στροφίῳ Φωκεῖ τρέφειν, ὁ δὲ αὐτὸν ἐκτρέφει μετὰ Πυλάδου παιδὸς ἰδίου. τελειωθεὶς δὲ Ὀρέστης εἰς Δελφοὺς παραγίνεται καὶ τὸν θεὸν ἐρωτᾷ, εἰ τοὺς αὐτόχειρας τοῦ πατρὸς μετέλθοι.

[24] But Electra, one of Agamemnon’s daughters, smuggled away her brother Orestes and gave him to Strophius, the Phocian, to bring up; and he brought him up with Pylades, his own son. And when Orestes was grown up, he repaired to Delphi and asked the god whether he should take vengeance on his father’s murderers.

[25] τοῦτο δὲ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐπιτρέποντος ἀπέρχεται εἰς Μυκήνας μετὰ Πυλάδου λαθραίως καὶ κτείνει τήν τε μητέρα καὶ τὸν Αἴγισθον, καὶ μετ᾽ οὐ πολὺ μανίᾳ κατασχεθεὶς ὑπὸ Ἐρινύων διωκόμενος εἰς Ἀθήνας παραγίνεται καὶ κρίνεται ἐν Ἀρείῳ πάγῳ,ὡς μὲν λέγουσί τινες ὑπὸ Ἐρινύων, ὡς δέ τινες ὑπὸ Τυνδάρεω, ὡς δέ τινες ὑπὸ Ἠριγόνης τῆς Αἰγίσθου καὶ Κλυταιμνήστρας, καὶ κριθεὶς ἴσων γενομένων τῶν ψήφων ἀπολύεται.

[25] The god gave him leave, so he departed secretly to Mycenae in company with Pylades, and killed both his mother and Aegisthus. And not long afterwards, being afflicted with madness and pursued by the Furies, he repaired to Athens and was tried in the Areopagus. He is variously said to have been brought to trial by the Furies, or by Tyndareus, or by Erigone, daughter of Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra; and the votes at his trial being equal he was acquitted.

[26] ἐρομένῳ δὲ αὐτῷ, πῶς ἂν ἀπαλλαγείη τῆς νόσου, ὁ θεὸς εἶπεν, εἰ τὸ ἐν Ταύροις ξόανον μετακομίσειεν.οἱ δὲ Ταῦροι μοῖρά ἐστι Σκυθῶν, οἳ τοὺς ξένους φονεύουσι καὶ εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν πῦρ ῥίπτουσι. τοῦτο ἦν ἐν τῷ τεμένει διά τινος πέτρας ἀναφερόμενον ἐξ Ἅιδου.

[26] When he inquired how he should be rid of his disorder, the god answered that he would be rid of it if he should fetch the wooden image that was in the land of the Taurians. Now the Taurians are a part of the Scythians, who murder strangers and throw them into the sacred fire, which was in the precinct, being wafted up from Hades through a certain rock.

[27] παραγενόμενος οὖν εἰς Ταύρους Ὀρέστης μετὰ Πυλάδου φωραθεὶς ἑάλω καὶ ἄγεται πρὸς Θόαντα τὸν βασιλέα δέσμιος, ὁ δὲ ἀμφοτέρους πρὸς τὴν ἱέρειαν ἀποστέλλει. ἐπιγνωσθεὶς δὲ ὑπὸ τῆς ἀδελφῆς ἱερὰ ποιούσης ἐν Ταύροις, ἄρας τὸ ξόανον σὺν αὐτῇ φεύγει.κομισθὲν δὲ εἰς Ἀθήνας νῦν λέγεται τὸ τῆς Ταυροπόλου: ἔνιοι δὲ αὐτὸν κατὰ χειμῶνα προσενεχθῆναι τῇ νήσῳ Ῥόδῳ λέγουσιν ... αὐτὸν καὶ κατὰ χρησμὸν ἐν τείχει καθοσιωθῆναι.

[27] So when Orestes was come with Pylades to the land of the Taurians, he was detected, caught, and carried in bonds before Thoas the king, who sent them both to the priestess. But being recognized by his sister, who acted as priestess among the Taurians, he fled with her, carrying off the wooden image. It was conveyed to Athens and is now called the image of Tauropolus. But some say that Orestes was driven in a storm to the island of Rhodes, ... and in accordance with an oracle the image was dedicated in a fortification wall.

[28] καὶ δὴ ἐλθὼν εἰς Μυκήνας Πυλάδῃ μὲν τὴν ἀδελφὴν Ἠλέκτραν συζεύγνυσιν, αὐτὸς δὲ γήμας Ἑρμιόνην, ἢ κατά τινας Ἠριγόνην, τεκνοῖ Τισαμενόν,καὶ δηχθεὶς ὑπὸ ὄφεως ἐν Ὀρεστείῳ τῆς Ἀρκαδίας θνήσκει.

[28] and having come to Mycenae, he united his sister Electra in marriage to Pylades, and having himself married Hermione, or, according to some, Erigone, he begat Tisamenus, and was killed by the bite of a snake at Oresteum in Arcadia.

[29] Μενέλαος δὲ πέντε ναῦς τὰς πάσας ἔχων μεθ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ προσσχὼν Σουνίῳ τῆς Ἀττικῆς ἀκρωτηρίῳ κἀκεῖθεν εἰς Κρήτην ἀπορριφεὶς πάλιν ὑπὸ ἀνέμων μακρὰν ἀπωθεῖται, καὶ πλανώμενος ἀνά τε Λιβύην καὶ Φοινίκην καὶ Κύπρον καὶ Αἴγυπτον πολλὰ συναθροίζει χρήματα. καὶ κατά τινας εὑρίσκεται παρὰ Πρωτεῖ τῷ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων βασιλεῖ Ἑλένη, μέχρι τότε εἴδωλον ἐκ νεφῶν ἐσχηκότος τοῦ Μενελάου. ὀκτὼ δὲ πλανηθεὶς ἔτη κατέπλευσεν εἰς Μυκήνας, κἀκεῖ κατέλαβεν Ὀρέστην μετεληλυθότα τὸν τοῦ πατρὸς φόνον. ἐλθὼν δὲ εἰς Σπάρτην τὴν ἰδίαν ἐκτήσατο βασιλείαν. καὶἀποθανατισθεὶς ὑπὸ Ἥρας εἰς τὸ Ἠλύσιον ἦλθε πεδίον μεθ᾽ Ἑλένης.

[29] Menelaus, with five ships in all under his command, put in at Sunium, a headland of Attica; and being again driven thence by winds to Crete he drifted far away, and wandering up and down Libya, and Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Egypt, he collected much treasure. And according to some, he discovered Helen at the court of Proteus, king of Egypt; for till then Menelaus had only a phantom of her made of clouds. And after wandering for eight years he came to port at Mycenae, and there found Orestes, who had avenged his father’s murder. And having come to Sparta he regained his own kingdom, and being made immortal by Hera he went to the Elysian Fields with Helen.

[1] ὁ δὲ Ὀδυσσεύς, ὡς μὲν ἔνιοι λέγουσιν, ἐπλανᾶτο κατὰ Λιβύην, ὡς δὲ ἔνιοι κατὰ Σικελίαν, ὡς δὲ ἄλλοι κατὰ τὸν Ὠκεανὸν ἢ κατὰ τὸ Τυρρηνικὸν πέλαγος.

[1] Ulysses, as some say, wandered about Libya, or, as some say, about Sicily, or, as others say, about the ocean or about the Tyrrhenian Sea.

[2] ἀναχθεὶς δὲ ἀπὸ Ἰλίου προσίσχει πόλει Κικόνων Ἰσμάρῳ καὶ ταύτην αἱρεῖ πολεμῶν καὶ λαφυραγωγεῖ, μόνου φεισάμενος Μάρωνος, ὃς ἦν ἱερεὺς Ἀπόλλωνος. αἰσθόμενοι δὲ οἱ τὴν ἤπειρον οἰκοῦντες Κίκονες σὺν ὅπλοις ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν παραγίνονται: ἀφ᾽ ἑκάστης δὲ νεὼς ἓξ ἀποβαλὼν ἄνδρας ἀναχθεὶς ἔφευγε.

[2] And putting to sea from Ilium, he touched at Ismarus, a city of the Cicones, and captured it in war, and pillaged it, sparing Maro alone, who was priest of Apollo. And when the Cicones who inhabited the mainland heard of it, they came in arms to withstand him, and having lost six men from each ship he put to sea and fled.

[3] καὶ καταντᾷ εἰς τὴν Λωτοφάγων χώραν καὶ πέμπει τινὰς μαθησομένους τοὺς κατοικοῦντας: οἱ δὲ γευσάμενοι τοῦ λωτοῦ κατέμειναν: ἐφύετο γὰρ ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ καρπὸς ἡδὺς λεγόμενος λωτός, ὃς τῷ γευσαμένῳ πάντων ἐποίει λήθην. Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ αἰσθόμενος, τοὺς λοιποὺς κατασχών, τοὺς γευσαμένους μετὰ βίας ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς ἄγει, καὶ προσπλεύσας τῇ Κυκλώπων γῇ προσπελάζει.

[3] And he landed in the country of the Lotus-eaters, and sent some to learn who inhabited it, but they tasted of the lotus and remained there; for there grew in the country a sweet fruit called lotus, which caused him who tasted it to forget everything. When Ulysses was informed of this, he restrained the rest of his men, and dragged those who had tasted the lotus by force to the ships. And having sailed to the land of the Cyclopes, he stood in for the shore.

[4] καταλιπὼν δὲ τὰς λοιπὰς ναῦς ἐν τῇ πλησίον νήσῳ, μίαν ἔχων τῇ Κυκλώπων γῇ προσπελάζει, μετὰ δώδεκα ἑταίρων ἀποβὰς τῆς νεώς. ἔστι δὲ τῆς θαλάσσης πλησίον ἄντρον, εἰς ὃ ἔρχεται ἔχων ἀσκὸν οἴνου τὸν ὑπὸ Μάρωνος αὐτῷ δοθέντα. ἦν δὲ Πολυφήμου τὸ ἄντρον, ὃς ἦν Ποσειδῶνος καὶ Θοώσης νύμφης, ἀνὴρ ὑπερμεγέθης ἄγριος ἀνδροφάγος, ἔχων ἕνα ὀφθαλμὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ μετώπου.

[4] And having left the rest of the ships in the neighboring island, he stood in for the land of the Cyclopes with a single ship, and landed with twelve companions. And near the sea was a cave which he entered, taking with him the skin of wine that had been given him by Maro. Now the cave belonged to Polyphemus, who was a son of Poseidon and the nymph Thoosa, a huge, wild, cannibal man, with one eye on his forehead.

[5] ἀνακαύσαντες δὲ πῦρ καὶ τῶν ἐρίφων θύσαντες εὐωχοῦντο. ἐλθὼν δὲ ὁ Κύκλωψ καὶ εἰσελάσας τὰ ποίμνια τῇ μὲν θύρᾳ προσέθηκε πέτρον ὑπερμεγέθη καὶ θεασάμενος αὐτοὺς ἐνίους κατήσθιεν.

[5] And having lit a fire and sacrificed some of the kids, they feasted. But the Cyclops came, and when he had driven in his flocks, he put a huge stone to the door, and perceiving the men he ate some of them.

[6] Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ αὐτῷ δίδωσιν ἐκ τοῦ Μάρωνος οἴνου πιεῖν: ὁ δὲ πιὼν πάλιν ᾔτησε, καὶ πιὼν τὸ δεύτερον ἐπηρώτα τὸ ὄνομα. τοῦ δὲ εἰπόντος ὅτι Οὔτις καλεῖται, Οὔτιν ἠπείλει ὕστερον ἀναλῶσαι, τοὺς δὲ ἄλλους ἔμπροσθεν, καὶ τοῦτο αὐτῷ ξένιον ἀποδώσειν ὑπέσχετο. κατασχεθεὶς δὲ ὑπὸ μέθης ἐκοιμήθη.

[6] But Ulysses gave him of Maro’s wine to drink, and when he had drunk, he asked for another draught, and when he had drunk the second, he inquired his name; and when Ulysses said that he was called Nobody, he threatened to devour Nobody last and the others first, and that was the token of friendship which he promised to give him in return. And being overcome by wine, he fell asleep.

[7] Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ εὑρὼν ῥόπαλον κείμενον σὺν τέσσαρσιν ἑταίροις ἀπώξυνε καὶ πυρώσας ἐξετύφλωσεν αὐτόν. ἐπιβοωμένου δὲ Πολυφήμου τοὺς πέριξ Κύκλωπας, παραγενόμενοι ἐπηρώτων τίς αὐτὸν ἀδικεῖ. τοῦ δὲ εἰπόντος ‘Οὔτις,’ νομίσαντες αὐτὸν λέγειν ‘ὑπὸ μηδενός’ ἀνεχώρησαν.

[7] But Ulysses found a club lying there, and with the help of four comrades he sharpened it, and, having heated it in the fire, he blinded him. And when Polyphemus cried to the Cyclopes round about for help, they came and asked who was hurting him, and when he said, “ Nobody,” they thought he meant that he was being hurt by nobody, and so they retired.

[8] ἐπιζητούντων δὲ τῶν ποιμνίων τὴν συνήθη νομήν, ἀνοίξας καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ προθύρου στὰς τὰς χεῖρας ἐκπετάσας ἐψηλάφα τὰ ποίμνια. Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ τρεῖς κριοὺς ὁμοῦ συνδέων ... καὶ αὐτὸς τῷ μείζονι ὑποδύς, ὑπὸ τὴν γαστέρα κρυβείς, σὺν τοῖς ποιμνίοις ἐξῆλθε, καὶ λύσας τοὺς ἑταίρους τῶν ποιμνίων, ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς ἐλάσας ἀποπλέων ἀνεβόησε Κύκλωπι ὡς Ὀδυσσεὺς εἴη καὶ ἐκπεφεύγοι τὰς ἐκείνου χεῖρας.

[8] And when the flocks sought their usual pasture, he opened the cave, and standing at the doorway spread out his hands and felt the sheep. But Ulysses tied three rams together, ... and himself getting under the bigger, and hiding under its belly, he passed out with the sheep. And having released his comrades from the sheep, he drove the animals to the ships, and sailing away shouted to the Cyclops that he was Ulysses and that he had escaped out of his hands.

[9] ἦν δὲ λόγιον Κύκλωπι εἰρημένον ὑπὸ μάντεως τυφλωθῆναι ὑπὸ Ὀδυσσέως. καὶ μαθὼν τὸ ὄνομα πέτρας ἀποσπῶν ἠκόντιζεν εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν, μόλις δὲ ἡ ναῦς σώζεται πρὸς τὰς πέτρας. ἐκ τούτου δὲ μηνίει Ποσειδῶν Ὀδυσσεῖ.

[9] Now the Cyclops had been forewarned by a soothsayer that he should be blinded by Ulysses; and when he learned the name, he tore away rocks and hurled them into the sea, and hardly did the ship evade the rocks. From that time Poseidon was wroth with Ulysses.

[10] ἀναχθεὶς δὲ συμπάσαις ναυσὶ παραγίνεται εἰς Αἰολίαν νῆσον, ἧς ὁ βασιλεὺς ἦν Αἴολος. οὗτος ἐπιμελητὴς ὑπὸ Διὸς τῶν ἀνέμων καθεστήκει καὶ παύειν καὶ προΐεσθαι. ὃς ξενίσας Ὀδυσσέα δίδωσιν αὐτῷ ἀσκὸν βόειον, ἐν ᾧ κατέδησε τοὺς ἀνέμους, ὑποδείξας οἷς δεῖ χρῆσθαι πλέοντα, τοῦτον ἐν τῷ σκάφει καταδήσας. ὁ δὲ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἐπιτηδείοις ἀνέμοις χρώμενος εὐπλοεῖ, καὶ πλησίον Ἰθάκης ὑπάρχων ἤδη τὸν ἀναφερόμενον ἐκ τῆς πόλεως καπνὸν ἰδὼν ἐκοιμήθη.

[10] Having put to sea with all his ships, he came to the island of Aeolia, of which the king was Aeolus. He was appointed by Zeus keeper of the winds, both to calm them and to send them forth. Having entertained Ulysses, he gave him an oxhide bag in which he had bound fast the winds, after showing what winds to use on the voyage and binding fast the bag in the vessel. And by using suitable winds Ulysses had a prosperous voyage; and when he was near Ithaca and already saw the smoke rising from the town, he fell asleep.

[11] οἱ δὲ ἑταῖροι νομίζοντες χρυσὸν ἐν τῷ ἀσκῷ κομίζειν αὐτόν, λύσαντες τοὺς ἀνέμους ἐξαφῆκαν, καὶ πάλιν εἰς τοὐπίσω παρεγένοντο ὑπὸ τῶν πνευμάτων ἁρπασθέντες. Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ ἀφικόμενος πρὸς Αἴολον ἠξίου πομπῆς τυχεῖν, ὁ δὲ αὐτὸν ἐκβάλλει τῆς νήσου λέγων ἀντιπρασσόντων τῶν θεῶν μὴ δύνασθαι σώζειν.

[11] But his comrades, thinking he carried gold in the bag, loosed it and let the winds go free, and being swept away by the blasts they were driven back again. And having come to Aeolus, Ulysses begged that he might be granted a fair wind; but Aeolus drove him from the island, saying that he could not save him when the gods opposed.

[12] πλέων οὖν κατῆρε πρὸς Λαιστρυγόνας, καὶ ... τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ναῦν καθώρμισεν ἐσχάτως. Λαιστρυγόνες δ᾽ ἦσαν ἀνδροφάγοι, καὶ αὐτῶν ἐβασίλευεν Ἀντιφάτης. μαθεῖν οὖν Ὀδυσσεὺς βουλόμενος τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἔπεμψέ τινας πευσομένους. τούτοις δὲ ἡ τοῦ βασιλέως θυγάτηρ συντυγχάνει καὶ αὐτοὺς ἄγει πρὸς τὸν πατέρα.

[12] So sailing on he came to the land of the Laestrygones, and ... his own ship he moored last. Now the Laestrygones were cannibals, and their king was Antiphates. Wishing, therefore, to learn about the inhabitants, Ulysses sent some men to inquire. But the king’s daughter met them and led them to her father.

[13] ὁ δὲ ἕνα μὲν αὐτῶν ἁρπάσας ἀναλίσκει, τοὺς δὲ λοιποὺς ἐδίωκε φεύγοντας κεκραγὼς καὶ συγκαλῶν τοὺς ἄλλους Λαιστρυγόνας. οἱ δὲ ἦλθον ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ βάλλοντες πέτροις τὰ μὲν σκάφη κατέαξαν, αὐτοὺς δὲ ἐβίβρωσκον. Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ κόψας τὸ πεῖσμα τῆς νεὼς ἀνήχθη, αἱ δὲ λοιπαὶ σὺν τοῖς πλέουσιν ἀπώλοντο.

[13] And he snatched up one of them and devoured him; but the rest fled, and he pursued them, shouting and calling together the rest of the Laestrygones. They came to the sea, and by throwing stones they broke the vessels and ate the men. Ulysses cut the cable of his ship and put to sea; but the rest of the ships perished with their crews.

[14] μίαν δὲ ἔχων ναῦν Αἰαίῃ νήσῳ προσίσχει. ταύτην κατῴκει Κίρκη, θυγάτηρ Ἡλίου καὶ Πέρσης, Αἰήτου δὲ ἀδελφή, πάντων ἔμπειρος οὖσα φαρμάκων. διελὼν τοὺς ἑταίρους αὐτὸς μὲν κλήρῳ μένει παρὰ τῇ νηί, Εὐρύλοχος δὲ πορεύεται μεθ᾽ ἑταίρων εἰκοσιδύο τὸν ἀριθμὸν πρὸς Κίρκην.

[14] With one ship he put in to the Aeaean isle. It was inhabited by Circe, a daughter of the Sun and of Perse, and a sister of Aeetes; skilled in all enchantments was she. Having divided his comrades, Ulysses himself abode by the ship, in accordance with the lot, but Eurylochus with two and twenty comrades repaired to Circe.

[15] καλούσης δὲ αὐτῆς χωρὶς Εὐρυλόχου πάντες εἰσίασιν. ἡ δ᾽ ἑκάστῳ κυκεῶνα πλήσασα τυροῦ καὶ μέλιτος καὶ ἀλφίτων καὶ οἴνου δίδωσι, μίξασα φαρμάκῳ. πιόντων δὲ αὐτῶν, ἐφαπτομένη ῥάβδῳ τὰς μορφὰς ἠλλοίου, καὶ τοὺς μὲν ἐποίει λύκους, τοὺς δὲ σῦς, τοὺς δὲ ὄνους, τοὺς δὲ λέοντας.

[15] At her call they all entered except Eurylochus; and to each she gave a tankard she had filled with cheese and honey and barley meal and wine, and mixed with an enchantment. And when they had drunk, she touched them with a wand and changed their shapes, and some she made wolves, and some swine, and some asses, and some lions.

[16] Εὐρύλοχος δὲ ἰδὼν ταῦτα Ὀδυσσεῖ ἀπαγγέλλει. ὁ δὲ λαβὼν μῶλυ παρὰ Ἑρμοῦ πρὸς Κίρκην ἔρχεται, καὶ βαλὼν εἰς τὰ φάρμακα τὸ μῶλυ μόνος πιὼν οὐ φαρμάσσεται: σπασάμενος δὲ τὸ ξίφος ἤθελε Κίρκην ἀποκτεῖναι. ἡ δὲ τὴν ὀργὴν παύσασα τοὺς ἑταίρους ἀποκαθίστησι. καὶ λαβὼν ὅρκους Ὀδυσσεὺς παρ᾽ αὐτῆς μηδὲν ἀδικηθῆναι συνευνάζεται, καὶ γίνεται αὐτῷ παῖς Τηλέγονος.

[16] But Eurylochus saw these things and reported them to Ulysses. And Ulysses went to Circe with moly, which he had received from Hermes, and throwing the moly among her enchantments, he drank and alone was not enchanted. Then drawing his sword, he would have killed her, but she appeased his wrath and restored his comrades. And when he had taken an oath of her that he should suffer no harm, Ulysses shared her bed, and a son, Telegonus, was born to him.

[17] ἐνιαυτὸν δὲ μείνας ἐκεῖ, πλεύσας τὸν Ὠκεανόν, σφάγια ταῖς ψυχαῖς ποιησάμενος μαντεύεται παρὰ Τειρεσίου, Κίρκης ὑποθεμένης, καὶ θεωρεῖ τάς τε τῶν ἡρώων ψυχὰς καὶ τῶν ἡρωΐδων. βλέπει δὲ καὶ τὴν μητέρα Ἀντίκλειαν καὶ Ἐλπήνορα, ὃς ἐν τοῖς Κίρκης πεσὼν ἐτελεύτησε.

[17] Having tarried a year there, he sailed the ocean, and offered sacrifices to the souls, and by Circe’s advice consulted the soothsayer Tiresias, and beheld the souls both of heroes and of heroines. He also looked on his mother Anticlia and Elpenor, who had died of a fall in the house of Circe.

[18] παραγενόμενος δὲ πρὸς Κίρκην ὑπ᾽ ἐκείνης προπεμφθεὶς ἀνήχθη, καὶ τὴν νῆσον παρέπλει τῶν Σειρήνων. αἱ δὲ Σειρῆνες ἦσαν Ἀχελῴου καὶ Μελπομένης μιᾶς τῶν Μουσῶν θυγατέρες, Πεισινόη Ἀγλαόπη Θελξιέπεια. τούτων ἡ μὲν ἐκιθάριζεν, ἡ δὲ ᾖδεν, ἡ δὲ ηὔλει, καὶ διὰ τούτων ἔπειθον καταμένειν τοὺς παραπλέοντας.

[18] And having come to Circe he was sent on his way by her, and put to sea, and sailed past the isle of the Sirens. Now the Sirens were Pisinoe, Aglaope, and Thelxiepia, daughters of Achelous and Melpomene, one of the Muses. One of them played the lyre, another sang, and another played the flute, and by these means they were fain to persuade passing mariners to linger;

[19] εἶχον δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν μηρῶν ὀρνίθων μορφάς. ταύτας παραπλέων Ὀδυσσεύς, τῆς ᾠδῆς βουλόμενος ὑπακοῦσαι, Κίρκης ὑποθεμένης τῶν μὲν ἑταίρων τὰ ὦτα ἔβυσε κηρῷ, ἑαυτὸν δὲ ἐκέλευσε προσδεθῆναι τῷ ἱστῷ. πειθόμενος δὲ ὑπὸ τῶν Σειρήνων καταμένειν ἠξίου λυθῆναι, οἱ δὲ μᾶλλον αὐτὸν ἐδέσμευον, καὶ οὕτω παρέπλει. ἦν δὲ αὐταῖς Σειρῆσι λόγιον τελευτῆσαι νεὼς παρελθούσης. αἱ μὲν οὖν ἐτελεύτων.

[19] and from the thighs they had the forms of birds. Sailing by them, Ulysses wished to hear their song, so by Circe’s advice he stopped the ears of his comrades with wax, and ordered that he should himself be bound to the mast. And being persuaded by the Sirens to linger, he begged to be released, but they bound him the more, and so he sailed past. Now it was predicted of the Sirens that they should themselves die when a ship should pass them; so die they did.

[20] μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο παραγίνεται ἐπὶ δισσὰς ὁδούς. ἔνθεν μὲν ἦσαν αἱ Πλαγκταὶ πέτραι, ἔνθεν δὲ ὑπερμεγέθεις σκόπελοι δύο. ἦν δὲ ἐν μὲν θατέρῳ Σκύλλα, Κραταιίδος θυγάτηρ καὶ † Τριήνου ἢ Φόρκου, πρόσωπον ἔχουσα καὶ στέρνα γυναικός, ἐκ λαγόνων δὲ κεφαλὰς ἓξ καὶ δώδεκα πόδας κυνῶν.

[20] And after that he came to two ways. On the one side were the Wandering Rocks, and on the other side two huge cliffs, and in one of them was Scylla, a daughter of Crataeis and Trienus or Phorcus, with the face and breast of a woman, but from the flanks she had six heads and twelve feet of dogs.

[21] ἐν δὲ θατέρῳ τῷ σκοπέλῳ ἦν Χάρυβδις, ἣ τῆς ἡμέρας τρὶς ἀνασπῶσα τὸ ὕδωρ πάλιν ἀνίει. ὑποθεμένης δὲ Κίρκης, τὸν μὲν παρὰ τὰς Πλαγκτὰς πλοῦν ἐφυλάξατο, παρὰ δὲ τὸν τῆς Σκύλλης σκόπελον πλέων ἐπὶ τῆς πρύμνης ἔστη καθωπλισμένος. ἐπιφανεῖσα δὲ ἡ Σκύλλα ἓξ ἑταίρους ἁρπάσασα τούτους κατεβίβρωσκεν.

[21] And in the other cliff was Charybdis, who thrice a day drew up the water and spouted it again. By the advice of Circe he shunned the passage by the Wandering Rocks, and in sailing past the cliff of Scylla he stood fully armed on the poop. But Scylla appeared, snatched six of his comrades, and gobbled them up.

[22] ἐκεῖθεν δὲ ἐλθὼν εἰς Θρινακίαν νῆσον οὖσαν Ἡλίου, ἔνθα βόες ἐβόσκοντο, καὶ ἀπλοίᾳ κατασχεθεὶς ἔμεινεν αὐτοῦ. τῶν δὲ ἑταίρων σφαξάντων ἐκ τῶν βοῶν καὶ θοινησαμένων, λειφθέντων τροφῆς, Ἥλιος ἐμήνυσε Διί. καὶ ἀναχθέντα κεραυνῷ ἔβαλε.

[22] And thence he came to Thrinacia, an island of the Sun, where kine were grazing, and being windbound, he tarried there. But when his comrades slaughtered some of the kine and banqueted on them, for lack of food, the Sun reported it to Zeus, and when Ulysses put out to sea, Zeus struck him with a thunderbolt.

[23] λυθείσης δὲ τῆς νεὼς Ὀδυσσεὺς τὸν ἱστὸν κατασχὼν παραγίνεται εἰς τὴν Χάρυβδιν. τῆς δὲ Χαρύβδεως καταπινούσης τὸν ἱστόν, ἐπιλαβόμενος ὑπερπεφυκότος ἐρινεοῦ περιέμεινε. καὶ πάλιν ἀνεθέντα τὸν ἱστὸν θεωρήσας, ἐπὶ τοῦτον ῥίψας εἰς Ὠγυγίαν νῆσον διεκομίσθη.

[23] And when the ship broke up, Ulysses clung to the mast and drifted to Charybdis. And when Charybdis sucked down the mast, he clutched an overhanging wild fig-tree and waited, and when he saw the mast shot up again, he cast himself on it, and was carried across to the island of Ogygia.

[24] ἐκεῖ δὲ ἀποδέχεται Καλυψὼ θυγάτηρ Ἄτλαντος, καὶ συνευνασθεῖσα γεννᾷ παῖδα Λατῖνον. μένει δὲ παρ᾽ αὐτῇ πενταετίαν, καὶ σχεδίαν ποιήσας ἀποπλεῖ. ταύτης δὲ ἐν τῷ πελάγει διαλυθείσης ὀργῇ Ποσειδῶνος, γυμνὸς πρὸς Φαίακας ἐκβράσσεται.

[24] There Calypso, daughter of Atlas, received him, and bedding with him bore a son Latinus. He stayed with her five years, and then made a raft and sailed away. But on the high sea the raft was broken in pieces by the wrath of Poseidon, and Ulysses was washed up naked on the shore of the Phaeacians.

[25] Ναυσικάα δέ, ἡ τοῦ βασιλέως θυγάτηρ Ἀλκινόου, πλύνουσα τὴν ἐσθῆτα ἱκετεύσαντα αὐτὸν ἄγει πρὸς Ἀλκίνοον, ὃς αὐτὸν ξενίζει καὶ δῶρα δοὺς μετὰ πομπῆς αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν πατρίδα ἐξέπεμψε. Ποσειδῶν δὲ Φαίαξι μηνίσας τὴν μὲν ναῦν ἀπελίθωσε, τὴν δὲ πόλιν ὄρει περικαλύπτει.

[25] Now Nausicaa, the daughter of king Alcinous, was washing the clothes, and when Ulysses implored her protection, she brought him to Alcinous, who entertained him, and after bestowing gifts on him sent him away with a convoy to his native land. But Poseidon was wroth with the Phaeacians, and he turned the ship to stone and enveloped the city with a mountain.

[26] Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ παραγενόμενος εἰς τὴν πατρίδα εὑρίσκει τὸν οἶκον διεφθαρμένον: νομίσαντες γὰρ αὐτὸν τεθνάναι Πηνελόπην ἐμνῶντο ἐκ Δουλιχίου μὲν νζ:

[26] And on arriving in his native land Ulysses found his substance wasted; for, believing that he was dead, suitors were wooing Penelope. From Dulichium came fifty-seven:

[27] Ἀμφίνομος Θόας Δημοπτόλεμος Ἀμφίμαχος Εὐρύαλος, Πάραλος Εὐηνορίδης Κλυτίος Ἀγήνωρ Εὐρύπυλος, Πυλαιμένης Ἀκάμας Θερσίλοχος Ἅγιος Κλύμενος, Φιλόδημος Μενεπτόλεμος Δαμάστωρ Βίας Τέλμιος, Πολύιδος Ἀστύλοχος Σχεδίος Ἀντίγονος Μάρψιος, Ἰφιδάμας Ἀργεῖος Γλαῦκος Καλυδωνεὺς Ἐχίων, Λάμας Ἀνδραίμων Ἀγέρωχος Μέδων Ἄγριος, Πρόμος Κτήσιος Ἀκαρνάν Κύκνος Ψηρᾶς, Ἑλλάνικος Περίφρων Μεγασθένης Θρασυμήδης Ὀρμένιος, Διοπίθης Μηκιστεὺς Ἀντίμαχος Πτολεμαῖος Λεστορίδης, Νικόμαχος Πολυποίτης Κεραός.

[27] Amphinomus, Thoas, Demoptolemus, Amphimachus, Euryalus, Paralus, Evenorides, Clytius, Agenor, Eurypylus, Pylaemenes, Acamas, Thersilochus, Hagius, Clymenus, Philodemus, Meneptolemus, Damastor, Bias, Telmius, Polyidus, Astylochus, Schedius, Antigonus, Marpsius, Iphidamas, Argius, Glaucus, Calydoneus, Echion, Lamas, Andraemon, Agerochus, Medon, Agrius, Promus, Ctesius, Acarnan, Cycnus, Pseras, Hellanicus, Periphron, Megasthenes, Thrasymedes, Ormenius, Diopithes, Mecisteus, Antimachus, Ptolemaeus, Lestorides, Nicomachus, Polypoetes, and Ceraus.

[28] ἐκ δὲ Σάμης κγ: Ἀγέλαος Πείσανδρος Ἔλατος Κτήσιππος Ἱππόδοχος, Εὐρύστρατος Ἀρχέμολος Ἴθακος Πεισήνωρ Ὑπερήνωρ, Φεροίτης Ἀντισθένης Κέρβερος Περιμήδης Κῦννος, Θρίασος Ἐτεωνεὺς Κλυτίος Πρόθοος Λύκαιθος, Εὔμηλος Ἴτανος Λύαμμος.

[28] And from Samethere came twenty — three: — Agelaus, Pisander, Elatus, Ctesippus, Hippodochus, Eurystratus, Archemolus, Ithacus, Pisenor, Hyperenor, Pheroetes, Antisthenes, Cerberus, Perimedes, Cynnus, Thriasus, Eteoneus, Clytius, Prothous, Lycaethus, Eumelus, Itanus, Lyammus.

[29] ἐκ δὲ Ζακύνθου μδ: Εὐρύλοχος Λαομήδης Μόλεβος Φρένιος Ἴνδιος, Μίνις Λειώκριτος Πρόνομος Νίσας Δαήμων, Ἀρχέστρατος Ἱππόμαχος Εὐρύαλος Περίαλλος Εὐηνορίδης, Κλυτίος Ἀγήνωρ Πόλυβος Πολύδωρος Θαδύτιος, Στράτιος Φρένιος Ἴνδιος Δαισήνωρ Λαομέδων, Λαόδικος Ἅλιος Μάγνης Ὀλοίτροχος Βάρθας, Θεόφρων Νισσαῖος Ἀλκάροψ Περικλύμενος Ἀντήνωρ, Πέλλας Κέλτος Περίφας Ὄρμενος Πόλυβος, Ἀνδρομήδης.

[29] And from Zacynthos came forty — four: Eurylochus, Laomedes, Molebus, Phrenius, Indius, Minis, Liocritus, Pronomus, Nisas, Daemon, Archestratus, Hippomachus, Euryalus, Periallus, Evenorides, Clytius, Agenor, Polybus, Polydorus, Thadytius, Stratius, Phrenius, Indius, Daesenor, Laomedon, Laodicus, Halius, Magnes, Oloetrochus, Barthas, Theophron, Nissaeus, Alcarops, Periclymenus, Antenor, Pellas, Celtus, Periphus, Ormenus, Polybus and Andromedes.

[30] ἐκ δὲ αὐτῆς Ἰθάκης ἦσαν οἱ μνηστευόμενοι ιβ οἵδε: Ἀντίνοος Πρόνοος Λειώδης Εὐρύνομος Ἀμφίμαχος, Ἀμφίαλος Πρόμαχος Ἀμφιμέδων Ἀρίστρατος Ἕλενος, Δουλιχιεὺς Κτήσιππος.

[30] And from Ithaca itself the suitors were twelve, to wit: — Antinous, Pronous, Liodes, Eurynomus, Amphimachus, Amphialus, Promachus, Amphimedon, Aristratus, Helenus, Dulicheus, and Ctesippus.

[31] οὗτοι πορευόμενοι εἰς τὰ βασίλεια δαπανῶντες τὰς Ὀδυσσέως ἀγέλας εὐωχοῦντο. Πηνελόπη δὲ ἀναγκαζομένη τὸν γάμον ὑπέσχετο ὅτε τὸ ἐντάφιον Λαέρτῃ πέρας ἕξει, καὶ τοῦτο ὕφηνεν ἐπὶ ἔτη τρία, μεθ᾽ ἡμέραν μὲν ὑφαίνουσα, νύκτωρ δὲ ἀναλύουσα. τοῦτον τὸν τρόπον ἐξηπατῶντο οἱ μνηστῆρες ὑπὸ τῆς Πηνελόπης, μέχρις ὅτε ἐφωράθη.

[31] These, journeying to the palace, consumed the herds of Ulysses at their feasts. And Penelope was compelled to promise that she would wed when the shroud of Laertes was finished, and she wove it for three years, weaving it by day and undoing it by night. In this way the suitors were deceived by Penelope, till she was detected.

[32] Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ μαθὼν τὰ κατὰ τὴν οἰκίαν, ὡς ἐπαίτης πρὸς Εὔμαιον οἰκέτην ἀφικνεῖται, καὶ Τηλεμάχῳ ἀναγνωρίζεται, καὶ παραγίνεται εἰς τὴν πόλιν. Μελάνθιος δὲ αὐτοῖς συντυχὼν ὁ αἰπόλος οἰκέτης ὑπάρχων ἀτιμάζει. παραγενόμενος δὲ εἰς τὰ βασίλεια τοὺς μνηστῆρας μετῄτει τροφήν, καὶ εὑρὼν μεταίτην Ἶρον καλούμενον διαπαλαίει αὐτῷ. Εὐμαίῳ δὲ μηνύσας ἑαυτὸν καὶ Φιλοιτίῳ, μετὰ τούτων καὶ Τηλεμάχου τοῖς μνηστῆρσιν ἐπιβουλεύει.

[32] And Ulysses, being apprized of the state of things at home, came to his servant Eumaeus in the guise of a beggar, and made himself known to Telemachus, and arrived in the city. And Melanthius, the goatherd, a servant man, met them, and scorned them. On coming to the palace Ulysses begged food of the suitors, and finding a beggar called Irus he wrestled with him. But he revealed himself to Eumaeus and Philoetius, and along with them and Telemachus he laid a plot for the suitors.

[33] Πηνελόπη δὲ τοῖς μνηστῆρσι τίθησιν Ὀδυσσέως τόξον, ὃ παρὰ Ἰφίτου ποτὲ ἔλαβε, καὶ τῷ τοῦτο τείναντί φησι συνοικήσειν. μηδενὸς δὲ τεῖναι δυναμένου, δεξάμενος Ὀδυσσεὺς τοὺς μνηστῆρας κατετόξευσε σὺν Εὐμαίῳ καὶ Φιλοιτίῳ καὶ Τηλεμάχῳ. ἀνεῖλε δὲ καὶ Μελάνθιον καὶ τὰς συνευναζομένας τοῖς μνηστῆρσι θεραπαίνας, καὶ τῇ γυναικὶ καὶ τῷ πατρὶ ἀναγνωρίζεται.

[33] Now Penelope delivered to the suitors the bow of Ulysses, which he had once received from Iphitus; and she said that she would marry him who bent the bow. When none of them could bend it, Ulysses took it and shot down the suitors, with the help of Eumaeus, Philoetius, and Telemachus. He killed also Melanthius, and the handmaids that bedded with the suitors, and he made himself known to his wife and his father.

[34] θύσας δὲ Ἅιδῃ καὶ Περσεφόνῃ καὶ Τειρεσίᾳ, πεζῇ διὰ τῆς Ἠπείρου βαδίζων εἰς Θεσπρωτοὺς παραγίνεται καὶ κατὰ τὰς Τειρεσίου μαντείας θυσιάσας ἐξιλάσκεται Ποσειδῶνα. ἡ δὲ βασιλεύουσα τότε Θεσπρωτῶν Καλλιδίκη καταμένειν αὐτὸν ἠξίου τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτῷ δοῦσα.

[34] And after sacrificing to Hades, and Persephone, and Tiresias, he journeyed on foot through Epirus, and came to the Thesprotians, and having offered sacrifice according to the directions of the soothsayer Tiresias, he propitiated Poseidon. But Callidice, who was then queen of the Thesprotians, urged him to stay and offered him the kingdom;

[35] καὶ συνελθοῦσα αὐτῷ γεννᾷ Πολυποίτην. γήμας δὲ Καλλιδίκην Θεσπρωτῶν ἐβασίλευσε καὶ μάχῃ τῶν περιοίκων νικᾷ τοὺς ἐπιστρατεύσαντας. Καλλιδίκης δὲ ἀποθανούσης, τῷ παιδὶ τὴν βασιλείαν ἀποδιδοὺς εἰς Ἰθάκην παραγίνεται, καὶ εὑρίσκει ἐκ Πηνελόπης Πολιπόρθην αὐτῷ γεγεννημένον.

[35] and she had by him a son Polypoetes. And having married Callidice, he reigned over the Thesprotians, and defeated in battle the neighboring peoples who attacked him. But when Callidice died he handed over the kingdom to his son and repaired to Ithaca, and there he found Poliporthes, whom Penelope had borne to him.

[36] Τηλέγονος δὲ παρὰ Κίρκης μαθὼν ὅτι παῖς Ὀδυσσέως ἐστίν, ἐπὶ τὴν τούτου ζήτησιν ἐκπλεῖ. παραγενόμενος δὲ εἰς Ἰθάκην τὴν νῆσον ἀπελαύνει τινὰ τῶν βοσκημάτων, καὶ Ὀδυσσέα βοηθοῦντα τῷ μετὰ χεῖρας δόρατι Τηλέγονος τρυγόνος κέντρον τὴν αἰχμὴν ἔχοντι τιτρώσκει, καὶ Ὀδυσσεὺς θνήσκει.

[36] When Telegonus learned from Circe that he was a son of Ulysses, he sailed in search of him. And having come to the island of Ithaca, he drove away some of the cattle, and when Ulysses defended them, Telegonus wounded him with the spear he had in his hands, which was barbed with the spine of a sting-ray, and Ulysses died of the wound.

[37] ἀναγνωρισάμενος δὲ αὐτὸν καὶ πολλὰ κατοδυράμενος, τὸν νεκρὸν καὶ τὴν Πηνελόπην πρὸς Κίρκην ἄγει, κἀκεῖ τὴν Πηνελόπην γαμεῖ. Κίρκη δὲ ἑκατέρους αὐτοὺς εἰς Μακάρων νήσους ἀποστέλλει.

[37] But when Telegonus recognized him, he bitterly lamented, and conveyed the corpse and Penelope to Circe, and there he married Penelope. And Circe sent them both away to the Islands of the Blest.

[38] τινὲς δὲ Πηνελόπην ὑπὸ Ἀντινόου φθαρεῖσαν λέγουσιν ὑπὸ Ὀδυσσέως πρὸς τὸν πατέρα Ἰκάριον ἀποσταλῆναι, γενομένην δὲ τῆς Ἀρκαδίας κατὰ Μαντίνειαν ἐξ Ἑρμοῦ τεκεῖν Πᾶνα:

[38] But some say that Penelope was seduced by Antinous and sent away by Ulysses to her father Icarius, and that when she came to Mantinea in Arcadia she bore Pan to Hermes.

[39] ἄλλοι δὲ δι᾽ Ἀμφίνομον ὑπὸ Ὀδυσσέως αὐτοῦ τελευτῆσαι: διαφθαρῆναι γὰρ αὐτὴν ὑπὸ τούτου λέγουσιν.

[39] However others say that she met her end at the hands of Ulysses himself on account of Amphinomus, for they allege that she was seduced by him.

[40] εἰσὶ δὲ οἱ λέγοντες ἐγκαλούμενον Ὀδυσσέα ὑπὸ τῶν οἰκείων ὑπὲρ τῶν ἀπολωλότων δικαστὴν Νεοπτόλεμον λαβεῖν τὸν βασιλεύοντα τῶν κατὰ τὴν Ἤπειρον νήσων, τοῦτον δέ, νομίσαντα ἐκποδὼν Ὀδυσσέως γενομένου Κεφαλληνίαν καθέξειν, κατακρῖναι φυγὴν αὐτοῦ, Ὀδυσσέα δὲ εἰς Αἰτωλίαν πρὸς Θόαντα τὸν Ἀνδραίμονος παραγενόμενον τὴν τούτου θυγατέρα γῆμαι, καὶ καταλιπόντα παῖδα Λεοντοφόνον ἐκ ταύτης γηραιὸν τελευτῆσαι.

[40] And there are some who say that Ulysses, being accused by the kinsfolk of the slain, submitted the case to the judgment of Neoptolemus, king of the islands off Epirus; that Neoptolemus, thinking to get possession of Cephallenia if once Ulysses were put out of the way, condemned him to exile; and that Ulysses went to Aetolia, to Thoas, son of Andraemon, married the daughter of Thoas, and leaving a son Leontophonus, whom he had by her, died in old age.
