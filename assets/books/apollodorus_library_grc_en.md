### CHAPTER I

[1] Οὐρανὸς πρῶτος τοῦ παντὸς ἐδυνάστευσε κόσμου. γήμας δὲ Γῆν ἐτέκνωσε πρώτους τοὺς ἑκατόγχειρας προσαγορευθέντας, Βριάρεων Γύην Κόττον, οἳ μεγέθει τε ἀνυπέρβλητοι καὶ δυνάμει καθειστήκεσαν, χεῖρας μὲν ἀνὰ ἑκατὸν κεφαλὰς δὲ ἀνὰ πεντήκοντα ἔχοντες.

[1] Sky was the first who ruled over the whole world. And having wedded Earth, he begat first the Hundred-handed, as they are named: Briareus, Gyes, Cottus, who were unsurpassed in size and might, each of them having a hundred hands and fifty heads.

[2] μετὰ τούτους δὲ αὐτῷ τεκνοῖ Γῆ Κύκλωπας, Ἄργην Στερόπην Βρόντην, ὧν ἕκαστος εἶχεν ἕνα ὀφθαλμὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ μετώπου. ἀλλὰ τούτους μὲν Οὐρανὸς δήσας εἰς Τάρταρον ἔρριψε （τόπος δὲ οὗτος ἐρεβώδης ἐστὶν ἐν Ἅιδου, τοσοῦτον ἀπὸ γῆς ἔχων διάστημα ὅσον ἀπ᾽ οὐρανοῦ γῆ）,

[2] After these, Earth bore him the Cyclopes, to wit, Arges, Steropes, Brontes, of whom each had one eye on his forehead. But them Sky bound and cast into Tartarus, a gloomy place in Hades as far distant from earth as earth is distant from the sky.

[3] τεκνοῖ δὲ αὖθις ἐκ Γῆς παῖδας μὲν τοὺς Τιτᾶνας προσαγορευθέντας, Ὠκεανὸν Κοῖον Ὑπερίονα Κρεῖον Ἰαπετὸν καὶ νεώτατον ἁπάντων Κρόνον, θυγατέρας δὲ τὰς κληθείσας Τιτανίδας, Τηθὺν Ῥέαν Θέμιν Μνημοσύνην Φοίβην Διώνην Θείαν.

[3] And again he begat children by Earth, to wit, the Titans as they are named: Ocean, Coeus, Hyperion, Crius, Iapetus, and, youngest of all, Cronus; also daughters, the Titanides as they are called: Tethys, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Dione, Thia.

[4] ἀγανακτοῦσα δὲ Γῆ ἐπὶ τῇ ἀπωλείᾳ τῶν εἰς Τάρταρον ῥιφέντων παίδων πείθει τοὺς Τιτᾶνας ἐπιθέσθαι τῷ πατρί, καὶ δίδωσιν ἀδαμαντίνην ἅρπην Κρόνῳ. οἱ δὲ Ὠκεανοῦ χωρὶς ἐπιτίθενται, καὶ Κρόνος ἀποτεμὼν τὰ αἰδοῖα τοῦ πατρὸς εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν ἀφίησεν. ἐκ δὲ τῶν σταλαγμῶν τοῦ ῥέοντος αἵματος ἐρινύες ἐγένοντο, Ἀληκτὼ Τισιφόνη Μέγαιρα. τῆς δὲ ἀρχῆς ἐκβαλόντες τούς τε καταταρταρωθέντας ἀνήγαγον ἀδελφοὺς καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν Κρόνῳ παρέδοσαν.

[4] But Earth, grieved at the destruction of her children, who had been cast into Tartarus, persuaded the Titans to attack their father and gave Cronus an adamantine sickle. And they, all but Ocean, attacked him, and Cronus cut off his father’s genitals and threw them into the sea; and from the drops of the flowing blood were born Furies, to wit, Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera. And, having dethroned their father, they brought up their brethren who had been hurled down to Tartarus, and committed the sovereignty to Cronus.

[5] ὁ δὲ τούτους μὲν ἐν τῷ Ταρτάρῳ πάλιν δήσας καθεῖρξε, τὴν δὲ ἀδελφὴν Ῥέαν γήμας, ἐπειδὴ Γῆ τε καὶ Οὐρανὸς ἐθεσπιῴδουν αὐτῷ λέγοντες ὑπὸ παιδὸς ἰδίου τὴν ἀρχὴν ἀφαιρεθήσεσθαι, κατέπινε τὰ γεννώμενα. καὶ πρώτην μὲν γεννηθεῖσαν Ἑστίαν κατέπιεν, εἶτα Δήμητραν καὶ Ἥραν, μεθ᾽ ἃς Πλούτωνα καὶ Ποσειδῶνα.

[5] But he again bound and shut them up in Tartarus, and wedded his sister Rhea; and since both Earth and Sky foretold him that he would be dethroned by his own son, he used to swallow his offspring at birth. His firstborn Hestia he swallowed, then Demeter and Hera, and after them Pluto and Poseidon.

[6] ὀργισθεῖσα δὲ ἐπὶ τούτοις Ῥέα παραγίνεται μὲν εἰς Κρήτην, ὁπηνίκα τὸν Δία ἐγκυμονοῦσα ἐτύγχανε, γεννᾷ δὲ ἐν ἄντρῳ τῆς Δίκτης Δία. καὶ τοῦτον μὲν δίδωσι τρέφεσθαι Κούρησί τε καὶ ταῖς Μελισσέως παισὶ νύμφαις, Ἀδραστείᾳ τε καὶ Ἴδῃ.

[6] Enraged at this, Rhea repaired to Crete, when she was big with Zeus, and brought him forth in a cave of Dicte. She gave him to the Curetes and to the nymphs Adrastia and Ida, daughters of Melisseus, to nurse.

[7] αὗται μὲν οὖν τὸν παῖδα ἔτρεφον τῷ τῆς Ἀμαλθείας γάλακτι, οἱ δὲ Κούρητες ἔνοπλοι ἐν τῷ ἄντρῳ τὸ βρέφος φυλάσσοντες τοῖς δόρασι τὰς ἀσπίδας συνέκρουον, ἵνα μὴ τῆς τοῦ παιδὸς φωνῆς ὁ Κρόνος ἀκούσῃ. Ῥέα δὲ λίθον σπαργανώσασα δέδωκε Κρόνῳ καταπιεῖν ὡς τὸν γεγεννημένον παῖδα.

[7] So these nymphs fed the child on the milk of Amalthea; and the Curetes in arms guarded the babe in the cave, clashing their spears on their shields in order that Cronus might not hear the child’s voice. But Rhea wrapped a stone in swaddling clothes and gave it to Cronus to swallow, as if it were the newborn child.

### CHAPTER II

[1] ἐπειδὴ δὲ Ζεὺς ἐγενήθη τέλειος, λαμβάνει Μῆτιν τὴν Ὠκεανοῦ συνεργόν, ἣ δίδωσι Κρόνῳ καταπιεῖν φάρμακον, ὑφ᾽ οὗ ἐκεῖνος ἀναγκασθεὶς πρῶτον μὲν ἐξεμεῖ τὸν λίθον, ἔπειτα τοὺς παῖδας οὓς κατέπιε: μεθ᾽ ὧν Ζεὺς τὸν πρὸς Κρόνον καὶ Τιτᾶνας ἐξήνεγκε πόλεμον. μαχομένων δὲ αὐτῶν ἐνιαυτοὺς δέκα ἡ Γῆ τῷ Διὶ ἔχρησε τὴν νίκην, τοὺς καταταρταρωθέντας ἂν ἔχῃ συμμάχους: ὁ δὲ τὴν φρουροῦσαν αὐτῶν τὰ δεσμὰ Κάμπην ἀποκτείνας ἔλυσε. καὶ Κύκλωπες τότε Διὶ μὲν διδόασι βροντὴν καὶ ἀστραπὴν καὶ κεραυνόν, Πλούτωνι δὲ κυνέην, Ποσειδῶνι δὲ τρίαιναν: οἱ δὲ τούτοις ὁπλισθέντες κρατοῦσι Τιτάνων, καὶ καθείρξαντες αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ Ταρτάρῳ τοὺς ἑκατόγχειρας κατέστησαν φύλακας. αὐτοὶ δὲ διακληροῦνται περὶ τῆς ἀρχῆς, καὶ λαγχάνει Ζεὺς μὲν τὴν ἐν οὐρανῷ δυναστείαν, Ποσειδῶν δὲ τὴν ἐν θαλάσσῃ, Πλούτων δὲ τὴν ἐν Ἅιδου.

[1] But when Zeus was full-grown, he took Metis, daughter of Ocean, to help him, and she gave Cronus a drug to swallow, which forced him to disgorge first the stone and then the children whom he had swallowed, and with their aid Zeus waged the war against Cronus and the Titans. They fought for ten years, and Earth prophesied victory to Zeus if he should have as allies those who had been hurled down to Tartarus. So he slew their jailoress Campe, and loosed their bonds. And the Cyclopes then gave Zeus thunder and lightning and a thunderbolt, and on Pluto they bestowed a helmet and on Poseidon a trident. Armed with these weapons the gods overcame the Titans, shut them up in Tartarus, and appointed the Hundred-handers their guards; but they themselves cast lots for the sovereignty, and to Zeus was allotted the dominion of the sky, to Poseidon the dominion of the sea, and to Pluto the dominion in Hades.

[2] ἐγένοντο δὲ Τιτάνων ἔκγονοι Ὠκεανοῦ μὲν καὶ Τηθύος Ὠκεανίδες, Ἀσία Στὺξ Ἠλέκτρα Δωρὶς Εὐρονόμη Ἀμφιτρίτη Μῆτις, Κοίου δὲ καὶ Φοίβης Ἀστερία καὶ Λητώ, Ὑπερίονος δὲ καὶ Θείας Ἠὼς Ἥλιος Σελήνη, Κρείου δὲ καὶ Εὐρυβίας τῆς Πόντου Ἀστραῖος Πάλλας Πέρσης,

[2] Now to the Titans were born offspring: to Ocean and Tethys were born Oceanids, to wit, Asia, Styx, Electra, Doris, Eurynome, Amphitrite, and Metis; to Coeus and Phoebe were born Asteria and Latona; to Hyperion and Thia were born Dawn, Sun, and Moon; to Crius and Eurybia, daughter of Sea （ Pontus）, were born Astraeus, Pallas, and Perses;

[3] Ιαπετοῦ δὲ καὶ Ἀσίας Ἄτλας, ὃς ἔχει τοῖς ὤμοις τὸν οὐρανόν, καὶ Προμηθεὺς καὶ Ἐπιμηθεὺς καὶ Μενοίτιος, ὃν κεραυνώσας ἐν τῇ τιτανομαχία Ζεὺς κατεταρτάρωσεν.

[3] to Iapetus and Asia was born Atlas, who has the sky on his shoulders, and Prometheus, and Epimetheus, and Menoetius, he whom Zeus in the battle with the Titans smote with a thunderbolt and hurled down to Tartarus.

[4] ἐγένετο δὲ καὶ Κρόνου καὶ Φιλύρας Χείρων διφυὴς Κένταυρος, Ἠοῦς δὲ καὶ Ἀστραίου ἄνεμοι καὶ ἄστρα, Πέρσου δὲ καὶ Ἀστερίας Ἑκάτη, Πάλλαντος δὲ καὶ Στυγὸς Νίκη Κράτος Ζῆλος Βία.

[4] And to Cronus and Philyra was born Chiron, a centaur of double form; and to Dawn and Astraeus were born winds and stars; to Perses and Asteria was born Hecate; and to Pallas and Styx were born Victory, Dominion, Emulation, and Violence.

[5] τὸ δὲ τῆς Στυγὸς ὕδωρ ἐκ πέτρας ἐν Ἅιδου ῥέον Ζεὺς ἐποίησεν ὅρκον, ταύτην αὐτῇ τιμὴν διδοὺς ἀνθ᾽ ὧν αὐτῷ κατὰ Τιτάνων μετὰ τῶν τέκνων συνεμάχησε.

[5] But Zeus caused oaths to be sworn by the water of Styx, which flows from a rock in Hades, bestowing this honor on her because she and her children had fought on his side against the Titans.

[6] Πόντου δὲ καὶ Γῆς Φόρκος Θαύμας Νηρεὺς Εὐρυβία Κητώ. Θαύμαντος μὲν οὖν καὶ Ἠλέκτρας Ἶρις καὶ ἅρπυιαι, Ἀελλὼ καὶ Ὠκυπέτη, Φόρκου δὲ καὶ Κητοῦς Φορκίδες καὶ Γοργόνες, περὶ ὧν ἐροῦμεν ὅταν τὰ κατὰ Περσέα λέγωμεν,

[6] And to Sea （ Pontus） and Earth were born Phorcus, Thaumas, Nereus, Eurybia, and Ceto. Now to Thaumas and Electra were born Iris and the Harpies, Aello and Ocypete; and to Phorcus and Ceto were born the Phorcides and Gorgons, of whom we shall speak when we treat of Perseus.

[7] Νηρέως δὲ καὶ Δωρίδος Νηρηίδες, ὧν τὰ ὀνόματα Κυμοθόη Σπειὼ Γλαυκονόμη Ναυσιθόη Ἁλίη, Ἐρατὼ Σαὼ Ἀμφιτρίτη Εὐνίκη Θέτις, Εὐλιμένη Ἀγαύη Εὐδώρη Δωτὼ Φέρουσα, Γαλάτεια Ἀκταίη Ποντομέδουσα Ἱπποθόη Λυσιάνασσα, Κυμὼ Ἠιόνη Ἁλιμήδη Πληξαύρη Εὐκράντη, Πρωτὼ Καλυψὼ Πανόπη Κραντὼ Νεόμηρις, Ἱππονόη Ἰάνειρα Πολυνόμη Αὐτονόη Μελίτη, Διώνη Νησαίη Δηρὼ Εὐαγόρη Ψαμάθη, Εὐμόλπη Ἰόνη Δυναμένη Κητὼ Λιμνώρεια.

[7] To Nereus and Doris were born the Nereids, whose names are Cymothoe, Spio, Glauconome, Nausithoe, Halie, Erato, Sao, Amphitrite, Eunice, Thetis, Eulimene, Agave, Eudore, Doto, Pherusa, Galatea, Actaea, Pontomedusa, Hippothoe, Lysianassa, Cymo, Eione, Halimede, Plexaure, Eucrante, Proto, Calypso, Panope, Cranto, Neomeris, Hipponoe, Ianira, Polynome, Autonoe, Melite, Dione, Nesaea, Dero, Evagore, Psamathe, Eumolpe, Ione, Dynamene, Ceto, and Limnoria.

### CHAPTER III

[1] Ζεὺς δὲ γαμεῖ μὲν Ἥραν, καὶ τεκνοῖ Ἥβην Εἰλείθυιαν Ἄρην, μίγνυται δὲ πολλαῖς θνηταῖς τε καὶ ἀθανάτοις γυναιξίν. ἐκ μὲν οὖν Θέμιδος τῆς Οὐρανοῦ γεννᾷ θυγατέρας ὥρας. Εἰρήνην Εὐνομίαν Δίκην, μοίρας, Κλωθὼ Λάχεσιν Ἄτροπον, ἐκ Διώνης δὲ Ἀφροδίτην, ἐξ Εὐρυνόμης δὲ τῆς Ὠκεανοῦ χάριτας, Ἀγλαΐην Εὐφροσύνην Θάλειαν, ἐκ δὲ Στυγὸς Περσεφόνην, ἐκ δὲ Μνημοσύνης μούσας, πρώτην μὲν Καλλιόπην, εἶτα Κλειὼ Μελπομένην Εὐτέρπην Ἐρατὼ Τερψιχόρην Οὐρανίαν Θάλειαν Πολυμνίαν.

[1] Now Zeus wedded Hera and begat Hebe, Ilithyia, and Ares, but he had intercourse with many women, both mortals and immortals. By Themis, daughter of Sky, he had daughters, the Seasons, to wit, Peace, Order, and Justice; also the Fates, to wit, Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropus; by Dione he had Aphrodite; by Eurynome, daughter of Ocean, he had the Graces, to wit, Aglaia, Euphrosyne, and Thalia; by Styx he had Persephone; and by Memory （ Mnemosyne） he had the Muses, first Calliope, then Clio, Melpomene, Euterpe, Erato, Terpsichore, Urania, Thalia, and Polymnia.

[2] Καλλιόπης μὲν οὖν καὶ Οἰάγρου, κατ᾽ ἐπίκλησιν δὲ Ἀπόλλωνος, Λίνος, ὃν Ἡρακλῆς ἀπέκτεινε, καὶ Ὀρφεὺς ὁ ἀσκήσας κιθαρῳδίαν, ὃς ᾁδων ἐκίνει λίθους τε καὶ δένδρα. ἀποθανούσης δὲ Εὐρυδίκης τῆς γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ, δηχθείσης ὑπὸ ὄφεως, κατῆλθεν εἰς Ἅιδου θέλων ἀνάγειν αὐτήν, καὶ Πλούτωνα ἔπεισεν ἀναπέμψαι. ὁ δὲ ὑπέσχετο τοῦτο ποιήσειν, ἂν μὴ πορευόμενος Ὀρφεὺς ἐπιστραφῇ πρὶν εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν αὑτοῦ παραγενέσθαι: ὁ δὲ ἀπιστῶν ἐπιστραφεὶς ἐθεάσατο τὴν γυναῖκα, ἡ δὲ πάλιν ὑπέστρεψεν. εὗρε δὲ Ὀρφεὺς καὶ τὰ Διονύσου μυστήρια, καὶ τέθαπται περὶ τὴν Πιερίαν διασπασθεὶς ὑπὸ τῶν μαινάδων.

[2] Now Calliope bore to Oeagrus or, nominally, to Apollo, a son Linus, whom Hercules slew; and another son, Orpheus, who practised minstrelsy and by his songs moved stones and trees. And when his wife Eurydice died, bitten by a snake, he went down to Hades, being fain to bring her up, and he persuaded Pluto to send her up. The god promised to do so, if on the way Orpheus would not turn round until he should be come to his own house. But he disobeyed and turning round beheld his wife; so she turned back. Orpheus also invented the mysteries of Dionysus, and having been torn in pieces by the Maenads he is buried in Pieria.

[3] Κλειὼ δὲ Πιέρου τοῦ Μάγνητος ἠράσθη κατὰ μῆνιν Ἀφροδίτης （ὠνείδισε γὰρ αὐτῇ τὸν τοῦ Ἀδώνιδος ἔρωτα）, συνελθοῦσα δὲ ἐγέννησεν ἐξ αὐτοῦ παῖδα Ὑάκινθον, οὗ Θάμυρις ὁ Φιλάμμωνος καὶ Ἀργιόπης νύμφης ἔσχεν ἔρωτα, πρῶτος ἀρξάμενος ἐρᾶν ἀρρένων. ἀλλ᾽ Ὑάκινθον μὲν ὕστερον Ἀπόλλων ἐρώμενον ὄντα δίσκῳ βαλὼν ἄκων ἀπέκτεινε, Θάμυρις δὲ κάλλει διενεγκὼν καὶ κιθαρῳδίᾳ περὶ μουσικῆς ἤρισε μούσαις, συνθέμενος, ἂν μὲν κρείττων εὑρεθῇ, πλησιάσειν πάσαις, ἐὰν δὲ ἡττηθῇ, στερηθήσεσθαι οὗ ἂν ἐκεῖναι θέλωσι. καθυπέρτεραι δὲ αἱ μοῦσαι γενόμεναι καὶ τῶν ὀμμάτων αὐτὸν καὶ τῆς κιθαρῳδίας ἐστέρησαν.

[3] Clio fell in love with Pierus, son of Magnes, in consequence of the wrath of Aphrodite, whom she had twitted with her love of Adonis; and having met him she bore him a son Hyacinth, for whom Thamyris, the son of Philammon and a nymph Argiope, conceived a passion, he being the first to become enamored of males. But afterwards Apollo loved Hyacinth and killed him involuntarily by the cast of a quoit. And Thamyris, who excelled in beauty and in minstrelsy, engaged in a musical contest with the Muses, the agreement being that, if he won, he should enjoy them all, but that if he should be vanquished he should be bereft of what they would. So the Muses got the better of him and bereft him both of his eyes and of his minstrelsy.

[4] Εὐτέρπης δὲ καὶ ποταμοῦ Στρυμόνος Ῥῆσος, ὃν ἐν Τροίᾳ Διομήδης ἀπέκτεινεν: ὡς δὲ ἔνιοι λέγουσι, Καλλιόπης ὑπῆρχεν. Θαλείας δὲ καὶ Ἀπόλλωνος ἐγένοντο Κορύβαντες, Μελπομένης δὲ καὶ Ἀχελῴου Σειρῆνες, περὶ ὧν ἐν τοῖς περὶ Ὀδυσσέως ἐροῦμεν.

[4] Euterpe had by the river Strymon a son Rhesus, whom Diomedes slew at Troy; but some say his mother was Calliope. Thalia had by Apollo the Corybantes; and Melpomene had by Achelous the Sirens, of whom we shall speak in treating of Ulysses.

[5] Ἥρα δὲ χωρὶς εὐνῆς ἐγέννησεν Ἥφαιστον: ὡς δὲ Ὅμηρος λέγει, καὶ τοῦτον ἐκ Διὸς ἐγέννησε. ῥίπτει δὲ αὐτὸν ἐξ οὐρανοῦ Ζεὺς Ἥρα δεθείσῃ βοηθοῦντα: ταύτην γὰρ ἐκρέμασε Ζεὺς ἐξ Ὀλύμπου χειμῶνα ἐπιπέμψασαν Ἡρακλεῖ, ὅτε Τροίαν ἑλὼν ἔπλει. πεσόντα δ᾽ Ἥφαιστον ἐν Λήμνῳ καὶ πηρωθέντα τὰς βάσεις διέσωσε Θέτις.

[5] Hera gave birth to Hephaestus without intercourse with the other sex, but according to Homer he was one of her children by Zeus. Him Zeus cast out of heaven, because he came to the rescue of Hera in her bonds. For when Hercules had taken Troy and was at sea, Hera sent a storm after him; so Zeus hung her from Olympus. Hephaestus fell on Lemnos and was lamed of his legs, but Thetis saved him.

[6] μίγνυται δὲ Ζεὺς Μήτιδι, μεταβαλλούσῃ εἰς πολλὰς ἰδέας ὑπὲρ τοῦ μὴ συνελθεῖν, καὶ αὐτὴν γενομένην ἔγκυον καταπίνει φθάσας, ἐπείπερ ἔλεγε Γῆ γεννήσειν παῖδα μετὰ τὴν μέλλουσαν ἐξ αὐτῆς γεννᾶσθαι κόρην, ὃς οὐρανοῦ δυνάστης γενήσεται. τοῦτο φοβηθεὶς κατέπιεν αὐτήν: ὡς δ᾽ ὁ τῆς γεννήσεως ἐνέστη χρόνος, πλήξαντος αὐτοῦ τὴν κεφαλὴν πελέκει Προμηθέως ἢ καθάπερ ἄλλοι λέγουσιν Ἡφαίστου, ἐκ κορυφῆς, ἐπὶ ποταμοῦ Τρίτωνος, Ἀθηνᾶ σὺν ὅπλοις ἀνέθορεν.

[6] Zeus had intercourse with Metis, who turned into many shapes in order to avoid his embraces. When she was with child, Zeus, taking time by the forelock, swallowed her, because Earth said that, after giving birth to the maiden who was then in her womb, Metis would bear a son who should be the lord of heaven. From fear of that Zeus swallowed her. And when the time came for the birth to take place, Prometheus or, as others say, Hephaestus, smote the head of Zeus with an axe, and Athena, fully armed, leaped up from the top of his head at the river Triton.

### CHAPTER IV

[1] τῶν δὲ Κοίου θυγατέρων Ἀστερία μὲν ὁμοιωθεῖσα ὄρτυγι ἑαυτὴν εἰς θάλασσαν ἔρριψε, φεύγουσα τὴν πρὸς Δία συνουσίαν: καὶ πόλις ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνης Ἀστερία πρότερον κληθεῖσα, ὕστερον δὲ Δῆλος. Λητὼ δὲ συνελθοῦσα Διὶ κατὰ τὴν γῆν ἅπασαν ὑφ᾽ Ἥρας ἠλαύνετο, μέχρις εἰς Δῆλον ἐλθοῦσα γεννᾷ πρώτην Ἄρτεμιν, ὑφ᾽ ἧς μαιωθεῖσα ὕστερον Ἀπόλλωνα ἐγέννησεν.Ἄρτεμις μὲν οὖν τὰ περὶ θήραν ἀσκήσασα παρθένος ἔμεινεν, Ἀπόλλων δὲ τὴν μαντικὴν μαθὼν παρὰ Πανὸς τοῦ Διὸς καὶ Ὕβρεως ἧκεν εἰς Δελφούς, χρησμῳδούσης τότε Θέμιδος: ὡς δὲ ὁ φρουρῶν τὸ μαντεῖον Πύθων ὄφις ἐκώλυεν αὐτὸν παρελθεῖν ἐπὶ τὸ χάσμα, τοῦτον ἀνελὼν τὸ μαντεῖον παραλαμβάνει. κτείνει δὲ μετ᾽ οὐ πολὺ καὶ Τιτυόν, ὃς ἦν Διὸς υἱὸς καὶ τῆς Ὀρχομενοῦ θυγατρὸς Ἐλάρης, ἣν Ζεύς, ἐπειδὴ συνῆλθε, δείσας Ἥραν ὑπὸ γῆν ἔκρυψε, καὶ τὸν κυοφορηθέντα παῖδα Τιτυὸν ὑπερμεγέθη εἰς φῶς ἀνήγαγεν. οὗτος ἐρχομένην εἰς Πυθὼ Λητὼ θεωρήσας, πόθῳ κατασχεθεὶς ἐπισπᾶται: ἡ δὲ τοὺς παῖδας ἐπικαλεῖται καὶ κατατοξεύουσιν αὐτόν. κολάζεται δὲ καὶ μετὰ θάνατον: γῦπες γὰρ αὐτοῦ τὴν καρδίαν ἐν Ἅιδου ἐσθίουσιν.

[1] Of the daughters of Coeus, Asteria in the likeness of a quail flung herself into the sea in order to escape the amorous advances of Zeus, and a city was formerly called after her Asteria, but afterwards it was named Delos. But Latona for her intrigue with Zeus was hunted by Hera over the whole earth, till she came to Delos and brought forth first Artemis, by the help of whose midwifery she afterwards gave birth to Apollo.Now Artemis devoted herself to the chase and remained a maid; but Apollo learned the art of prophecy from Pan, the son of Zeus and Hybris, and came to Delphi, where Themis at that time used to deliver oracles; and when the snake Python, which guarded the oracle, would have hindered him from approaching the chasm, he killed it and took over the oracle. Not long afterwards he slew also Tityus, who was a son of Zeus and Elare, daughter of Orchomenus; for her, after he had debauched her, Zeus hid under the earth for fear of Hera, and brought forth to the light the son Tityus, of monstrous size, whom she had borne in her womb. When Latona came to Pytho, Tityus beheld her, and overpowered by lust drew her to him. But she called her children to her aid, and they shot him down with their arrows. And he is punished even after death; for vultures eat his heart in Hades.

[2] ἀπέκτεινε δὲ Ἀπόλλων καὶ τὸν Ὀλύμπου παῖδα Μαρσύαν. οὗτος γὰρ εὑρὼν αὐλούς, οὓς ἔρριψεν Ἀθηνᾶ διὰ τὸ τὴν ὄψιν αὐτῆς ποιεῖν ἄμορφον, ἦλθεν εἰς ἔριν περὶ μουσικῆς Ἀπόλλωνι. συνθεμένων δὲ αὐτῶν ἵνα ὁ νικήσας ὃ βούλεται διαθῇ τὸν ἡττημένον, τῆς κρίσεως γινομένης τὴν κιθάραν στρέψας ἠγωνίζετο ὁ Ἀπόλλων, καὶ ταὐτὸ ποιεῖν ἐκέλευσε τὸν Μαρσύαν: τοῦ δὲ ἀδυνατοῦντος εὑρεθεὶς κρείσσων ὁ Ἀπόλλων, κρεμάσας τὸν Μαρσύαν ἔκ τινος ὑπερτενοῦς πίτυος, ἐκτεμὼν τὸ δέρμα οὕτως διέφθειρεν.

[2] Apollo also slew Marsyas, the son of Olympus. For Marsyas, having found the pipes which Athena had thrown away because they disfigured her face, engaged in a musical contest with Apollo. They agreed that the victor should work his will on the vanquished, and when the trial took place Apollo turned his lyre upside down in the competition and bade Marsyas do the same. But Marsyas could not, so Apollo was judged the victor and despatched Marsyas by hanging him on a tall pine tree and stripping off his skin.

[3] Ὠρίωνα δὲ Ἄρτεμις ἀπέκτεινεν ἐν Δήλῳ. τοῦτον γηγενῆ λέγουσιν ὑπερμεγέθη τὸ σῶμα: Φερεκύδης δὲ αὐτὸν Ποσειδῶνος καὶ Εὐρυάλης λέγει. ἐδωρήσατο δὲ αὐτῷ Ποσειδῶν διαβαίνειν τὴν θάλασσαν. οὗτος πρώτην μὲν ἔγημε Σίδην, ἣν ἔρριψεν εἰς Ἅιδου περὶ μορφῆς ἐρίσασαν Ἥρα: αὖθις δὲ ἐλθὼν εἰς Χίον Μερόπην τὴν Οἰνοπίωνος ἐμνηστεύσατο. μεθύσας δὲ Οἰνοπίων αὐτὸν κοιμώμενον ἐτύφλωσε καὶ παρὰ τοῖς αἰγιαλοῖς ἔρριψεν. ὁ δὲ ἐπὶ τὸ Ἡφαίστου χαλκεῖον ἐλθὼν καὶ ἁρπάσας παῖδα ἕνα, ἐπὶ τῶν ὤμων ἐπιθέμενος ἐκέλευσε ποδηγεῖν πρὸς τὰς ἀνατολάς. ἐκεῖ δὲ παραγενόμενος ἀνέβλεψεν ἐξακεσθεὶς ὑπὸ τῆς ἡλιακῆς ἀκτῖνος, καὶ διὰ ταχέων ἐπὶ τὸν Οἰνοπίωνα ἔσπευδεν.

[3] And Artemis slew Orion in Delos. They say that he was of gigantic stature and born of the earth; but Pherecydes says that he was a son of Poseidon and Euryale. Poseidon bestowed on him the power of striding across the sea. He first married Side, whom Hera cast into Hades because she rivalled herself in beauty. Afterwards he went to Chios and wooed Merope, daughter of Oenopion. But Oenopion made him drunk, put out his eyes as he slept, and cast him on the beach. But he went to the smithy of Hephaestus, and snatching up a lad set him on his shoulders and bade him lead him to the sunrise. Being come thither he was healed by the sun’s rays, and having recovered his sight he hastened with all speed against Oenopion.

[4] ἀλλὰ τῷ μὲν Ποσειδῶν ἡφαιστότευκτον ὑπὸ γῆν κατεσκεύασεν οἶκον, Ὠρίωνος δ᾽ Ἠὼς ἐρασθεῖσα ἥρπασε καὶ ἐκόμισεν εἰς Δῆλον: ἐποίει γὰρ αὐτὴν Ἀφροδίτη συνεχῶς ἐρᾶν, ὅτι Ἄρει συνευνάσθη.

[4] But for him Poseidon had made ready a house under the earth constructed by Hephaestus. And Dawn fell in love with Orion and carried him off and brought him to Delos; for Aphrodite caused Dawn to be perpetually in love, because she had bedded with Ares.

[5] ὁ δ᾽ Ὠρίων, ὡς μὲν ἔνιοι λέγουσιν, ἀνῃρέθη δισκεύειν Ἄρτεμιν προκαλούμενος, ὡς δέ τινες, βιαζόμενος Ὦπιν μίαν τῶν ἐξ Ὑπερβορέων παραγενομένων παρθένων ὑπ᾽ Ἀρτέμιδος ἐτοξεύθη.Ποσειδῶν δὲ Ἀμφιτρίτην τὴν Ὠκεανοῦ γαμεῖ, καὶ αὐτῷ γίνεται Τρίτων καὶ Ῥόδη, ἣν Ἥλιος ἔγημε.

[5] But Orion was killed, as some say, for challenging Artemis to a match at quoits, but some say he was shot by Artemis for offering violence to Opis, one of the maidens who had come from the Hyperboreans.Poseidon wedded Amphitrite, daughter of Ocean, and there were born to him Triton and Rhode, who was married to the Sun.

### CHAPTER V

[1] Πλούτων δὲ Περσεφόνης ἐρασθεὶς Διὸς συνεργοῦντος ἥρπασεν αὐτὴν κρύφα. Δημήτηρ δὲ μετὰ λαμπάδων νυκτός τε καὶ ἡμέρας κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ζητοῦσα περιῄει: μαθοῦσα δὲ παρ᾽ Ἑρμιονέων ὅτι Πλούτων αὐτὴν ἥρπασεν, ὀργιζομένη θεοῖς κατέλιπεν οὐρανόν, εἰκασθεῖσα δὲ γυναικὶ ἧκεν εἰς Ἐλευσῖνα. καὶ πρῶτον μὲν ἐπὶ τὴν ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνης κληθεῖσαν Ἀγέλαστον ἐκάθισε πέτραν παρὰ τὸ Καλλίχορον φρέαρ καλούμενον, ἔπειτα πρὸς Κελεὸν ἐλθοῦσα τὸν βασιλεύοντα τότε Ἐλευσινίων, ἔνδον οὐσῶν γυναικῶν, καὶ λεγουσῶν τούτων παρ᾽ αὑτὰς καθέζεσθαι, γραῖά τις Ἰάμβη σκώψασα τὴν θεὸν ἐποίησε μειδιᾶσαι. διὰ τοῦτο ἐν τοῖς θεσμοφορίοις τὰς γυναῖκας σκώπτειν λέγουσιν.ὄντος δὲ τῇ τοῦ Κελεοῦ γυναικὶ Μετανείρᾳ παιδίου, τοῦτο ἔτρεφεν ἡ Δημήτηρ παραλαβοῦσα: βουλομένη δὲ αὐτὸ ἀθάνατον ποιῆσαι, τὰς νύκτας εἰς πῦρ κατετίθει τὸ βρέφος καὶ περιῄρει τὰς θνητὰς σάρκας αὐτοῦ. καθ᾽ ἡμέραν δὲ παραδόξως αὐξανομένου τοῦ Δημοφῶντος （τοῦτο γὰρ ἦν ὄνομα τῷ παιδί） ἐπετήρησεν ἡ Πραξιθέα, καὶ καταλαβοῦσα εἰς πῦρ ἐγκεκρυμμένον ἀνεβόησε: διόπερ τὸ μὲν βρέφος ὑπὸ τοῦ πυρὸς ἀνηλώθη, ἡ θεὰ δὲ αὑτὴν ἐξέφηνε.

[1] Pluto fell in love with Persephone and with the help of Zeus carried her off secretly. But Demeter went about seeking her all over the earth with torches by night and day, and learning from the people of Hermion that Pluto had carried her off, she was wroth with the gods and quitted heaven, and came in the likeness of a woman to Eleusis. And first she sat down on the rock which has been named Laughless after her, beside what is called the Well of the Fair Dances; thereupon she made her way to Celeus, who at that time reigned over the Eleusinians. Some women were in the house, and when they bade her sit down beside them, a certain old crone, Iambe, joked the goddess and made her smile. For that reason they say that the women break jests at the Thesmophoria.But Metanira, wife of Celeus, had a child and Demeter received it to nurse, and wishing to make it immortal she set the babe of nights on the fire and stripped off its mortal flesh. But as Demophon — for that was the child’s name — grew marvelously by day, Praxithea watched, and discovering him buried in the fire she cried out; wherefore the babe was consumed by the fire and the goddess revealed herself.

[2] Τριπτολέμῳ δὲ τῷ πρεσβυτέρῳ τῶν Μετανείρας παίδων δίφρον κατασκευάσασα πτηνῶν δρακόντων τὸν πυρὸν ἔδωκεν, ᾧ τὴν ὅλην οἰκουμένην δι᾽ οὐρανοῦ αἰρόμενος κατέσπειρε. Πανύασις δὲ Τριπτόλεμον Ἐλευσῖνος λέγει: φησὶ γὰρ Δήμητρα πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐλθεῖν. Φερεκύδης δέ φησιν αὐτὸν Ὠκεανοῦ καὶ Γῆς.

[2] But for Triptolemus, the elder of Metanira’s children, she made a chariot of winged dragons, and gave him wheat, with which, wafted through the sky, he sowed the whole inhabited earth. But Panyasis affirms that Triptolemus was a son of Eleusis, for he says that Demeter came to him. Pherecydes, however, says that he was a son of Ocean and Earth.

[3] Διὸς δὲ Πλούτωνι τὴν Κόρην ἀναπέμψαι κελεύσαντος, ὁ Πλούτων, ἵνα μὴ πολὺν χρόνον παρὰ τῇ μητρὶ καταμείνῃ, ῥοιᾶς ἔδωκεν αὐτῇ φαγεῖν κόκκον. ἡ δὲ οὐ προϊδομένη τὸ συμβησόμενον κατηνάλωσεν αὐτόν. καταμαρτυρήσαντος δὲ αὐτῆς Ἀσκαλάφου τοῦ Ἀχέροντος καὶ Γοργύρας, τούτῳ μὲν Δημήτηρ ἐν Ἅιδου βαρεῖαν ἐπέθηκε πέτραν, Περσεφόνη δὲ καθ᾽ ἕκαστον ἐνιαυτὸν τὸ μὲν τρίτον μετὰ Πλούτωνος ἠναγκάσθη μένειν, τὸ δὲ λοιπὸν παρὰ τοῖς θεοῖς.

[3] But when Zeus ordered Pluto to send up the Maid, Pluto gave her a seed of a pomegranate to eat, in order that she might not tarry long with her mother. Not foreseeing the consequence, she swallowed it; and because Ascalaphus, son of Acheron and Gorgyra, bore witness against her, Demeter laid a heavy rock on him in Hades. But Persephone was compelled to remain a third of every year with Pluto and the rest of the time with the gods.

### CHAPTER VI

[1] περὶ μὲν οὖν Δήμητρος ταῦτα λέγεται: Γῆ δὲ περὶ Τιτάνων ἀγανακτοῦσα γεννᾷ Γίγαντας ἐξ Οὐρανοῦ, μεγέθει μὲν σωμάτων ἀνυπερβλήτους, δυνάμει δὲ ἀκαταγωνίστους, οἳ φοβεροὶ μὲν ταῖς ὄψεσι κατεφαίνοντο, καθειμένοι βαθεῖαν κόμην ἐκ κεφαλῆς καὶ γενείων, εἶχον δὲ τὰς βάσεις φολίδας δρακόντων. ἐγένοντο δέ, ὡς μέν τινες λέγουσιν, ἐν Φλέγραις, ὡς δὲ ἄλλοι, ἐν Παλλήνῃ. ἠκόντιζον δὲ εἰς οὐρανὸν πέτρας καὶ δρῦς ἡμμένας. διέφερον δὲ πάντων Πορφυρίων τε καὶ Ἀλκυονεύς, ὃς δὴ καὶ ἀθάνατος ἦν ἐν ᾗπερ ἐγεννήθη γῇ μαχόμενος. οὗτος δὲ καὶ τὰς Ἡλίου βόας ἐξ Ἐρυθείας ἤλασε. τοῖς δὲ θεοῖς λόγιον ἦν ὑπὸ θεῶν μὲν μηδένα τῶν Γιγάντων ἀπολέσθαι δύνασθαι, συμμαχοῦντος δὲ θνητοῦ τινος τελευτήσειν. αἰσθομένη δὲ Γῆ τοῦτο ἐζήτει φάρμακον, ἵνα μηδ᾽ ὑπὸ θνητοῦ δυνηθῶσιν ἀπολέσθαι. Ζεὺς δ᾽ ἀπειπὼν φαίνειν Ἠοῖ τε καὶ Σελήνῃ καὶ Ἡλίῳ τὸ μὲν φάρμακον αὐτὸς ἔτεμε φθάσας, Ἡρακλέα δὲ σύμμαχον δι᾽ Ἀθηνᾶς ἐπεκαλέσατο. κἀκεῖνος πρῶτον μὲν ἐτόξευσεν Ἀλκυονέα: πίπτων δὲ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς μᾶλλον ἀνεθάλπετο: Ἀθηνᾶς δὲ ὑποθεμένης ἔξω τῆς Παλλήνης εἵλκυσεν αὐτόν.

[1] Such is the legend of Demeter. But Earth, vexed on account of the Titans, brought forth the giants, whom she had by Sky. These were matchless in the bulk of their bodies and invincible in their might; terrible of aspect did they appear, with long locks drooping from their head and chin, and with the scales of dragons for feet. They were born, as some say, in Phlegrae, but according to others in Pallene. And they darted rocks and burning oaks at the sky. Surpassing all the rest were Porphyrion and Alcyoneus, who was even immortal so long as he fought in the land of his birth. He also drove away the cows of the Sun from Erythia. Now the gods had an oracle that none of the giants could perish at the hand of gods, but that with the help of a mortal they would be made an end of. Learning of this, Earth sought for a simple to prevent the giants from being destroyed even by a mortal. But Zeus forbade the Dawn and the Moon and the Sun to shine, and then, before anybody else could get it, he culled the simple himself, and by means of Athena summoned Hercules to his help. Hercules first shot Alcyoneus with an arrow, but when the giant fell on the ground he somewhat revived. However, at Athena’s advice Hercules dragged him outside Pallene, and so the giant died.

[2] κἀκεῖνος μὲν οὕτως ἐτελεύτα, Πορφυρίων δὲ Ἡρακλεῖ κατὰ τὴν μάχην ἐφώρμησε καὶ Ἥρᾳ. Ζεὺς δὲ αὐτῷ πόθον Ἥρας ἐνέβαλεν, ἥτις καὶ καταρρηγνύντος αὐτοῦ τοὺς πέπλους καὶ βιάζεσθαι θέλοντος βοηθοὺς ἐπεκαλεῖτο: καὶ Διὸς κεραυνώσαντος αὐτὸν Ἡρακλῆς τοξεύσας ἀπέκτεινε. τῶν δὲ λοιπῶν Ἀπόλλων μὲν Ἐφιάλτου τὸν ἀριστερὸν ἐτόξευσεν ὀφθαλμόν, Ἡρακλῆς δὲ τὸν δεξιόν: Εὔρυτον δὲ θύρσῳ Διόνυσος ἔκτεινε, Κλυτίον δὲ δᾳσὶν Ἑκάτη, Μίμαντα δὲ Ἥφαιστος βαλὼν μύδροις. Ἀθηνᾶ δὲ Ἐγκελάδῳ φεύγοντι Σικελίαν ἐπέρριψε τὴν νῆσον, Πάλλαντος δὲ τὴν δορὰν ἐκτεμοῦσα ταύτῃ κατὰ τὴν μάχην τὸ ἴδιον ἐπέσκεπε σῶμα. Πολυβώτης δὲ διὰ τῆς θαλάσσης διωχθεὶς ὑπὸ τοῦ Ποσειδῶνος ἧκεν εἰς Κῶ: Ποσειδῶν δὲ τῆς νήσου μέρος ἀπορρήξας ἐπέρριψεν αὐτῷ, τὸ λεγόμενον Νίσυρον. Ἑρμῆς δὲ τὴν Ἄιδος κυνῆν ἔχων κατὰ τὴν μάχην Ἱππόλυτον ἀπέκτεινεν, Ἄρτεμις δὲ † Γρατίωνα, μοῖραι δ᾽ Ἄγριον καὶ Θόωνα χαλκέοις ῥοπάλοις μαχόμεναι τοὺς δὲ ἄλλους κεραυνοῖς Ζεὺς βαλὼν διέφθειρε: πάντας δὲ Ἡρακλῆς ἀπολλυμένους ἐτόξευσεν.

[2] But in the battle Porphyrion attacked Hercules and Hera. Nevertheless Zeus inspired him with lust for Hera, and when he tore her robes and would have forced her, she called for help, and Zeus smote him with a thunderbolt, and Hercules shot him dead with an arrow. As for the other giants, Ephialtes was shot by Apollo with an arrow in his left eye and by Hercules in his right; Eurytus was killed by Dionysus with a thyrsus, and Clytius by Hecate with torches, and Mimas by Hephaestus with missiles of red-hot metal. Enceladus fled, but Athena threw on him in his flight the island of Sicily; and she flayed Pallas and used his skin to shield her own body in the fight. Polybotes was chased through the sea by Poseidon and came to Cos; and Poseidon, breaking off that piece of the island which is called Nisyrum, threw it on him. And Hermes, wearing the helmet of Hades, slew Hippolytus in the fight, and Artemis slew Gration. And the Fates, fighting with brazer clubs, killed Agrius and Thoas. The other giants Zeus smote and destroyed with thunderbolts and all of them Hercules shot with arrows as they were dying.

[3] ὡς δ᾽ ἐκράτησαν οἱ θεοὶ τῶν Γιγάντων, Γῆ μᾶλλον χολωθεῖσα μίγνυται Ταρτάρῳ, καὶ γεννᾷ Τυφῶνα ἐν Κιλικίᾳ, μεμιγμένην ἔχοντα φύσιν ἀνδρὸς καὶ θηρίου. οὗτος μὲν καὶ μεγέθει καὶ δυνάμει πάντων διήνεγκεν ὅσους ἐγέννησε Γῆ, ἦν δὲ αὐτῷ τὰ μὲν ἄχρι μηρῶν ἄπλετον μέγεθος ἀνδρόμορφον, ὥστε ὑπερέχειν μὲν πάντων τῶν ὀρῶν, ἡ δὲ κεφαλὴ πολλάκις καὶ τῶν ἄστρων ἔψαυε: χεῖρας δὲ εἶχε τὴν μὲν ἐπὶ τὴν ἑσπέραν ἐκτεινομένην τὴν δὲ ἐπὶ τὰς ἀνατολάς: ἐκ τούτων δὲ ἐξεῖχον ἑκατὸν κεφαλαὶ δρακόντων. τὰ δὲ ἀπὸ μηρῶν σπείρας εἶχεν ὑπερμεγέθεις ἐχιδνῶν, ὧν ὁλκοὶ πρὸς αὐτὴν ἐκτεινόμενοι κορυφὴν συριγμὸν πολὺν ἐξίεσαν. πᾶν δὲ αὐτοῦ τὸ σῶμα κατεπτέρωτο, αὐχμηραὶ δὲ ἐκ κεφαλῆς καὶ γενύων τρίχες ἐξηνέμωντο, πῦρ δὲ ἐδέρκετο τοῖς ὄμμασι. τοιοῦτος ὢν ὁ Τυφὼν καὶ τηλικοῦτος ἡμμένας βάλλων πέτρας ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν τὸν οὐρανὸν μετὰ συριγμῶν ὁμοῦ καὶ βοῆς ἐφέρετο: πολλὴν δὲ ἐκ τοῦ στόματος πυρὸς ἐξέβρασσε ζάλην. θεοὶ δ᾽ ὡς εἶδον αὐτὸν ἐπ᾽ οὐρανὸν ὁρμώμενον, εἰς Αἴγυπτον φυγάδες ἐφέροντο, καὶ διωκόμενοι τὰς ἰδέας μετέβαλον εἰς ζῷα. Ζεὺς δὲ πόρρω μὲν ὄντα Τυφῶνα ἔβαλλε κεραυνοῖς, πλησίον δὲ γενόμενον ἀδαμαντίνῃ κατέπληττεν ἅρπῃ, καὶ φεύγοντα ἄχρι τοῦ Κασίου ὄρους συνεδίωξε: τοῦτο δὲ ὑπέρκειται Συρίας. κεῖθι δὲ αὐτὸν κατατετρωμένον ἰδὼν εἰς χεῖρας συνέβαλε. Τυφὼν δὲ ταῖς σπείραις περιπλεχθεὶς κατέσχεν αὐτόν, καὶ τὴν ἅρπην περιελόμενος τά τε τῶν χειρῶν καὶ ποδῶν διέτεμε νεῦρα, ἀράμενος δὲ ἐπὶ τῶν ὤμων διεκόμισεν αὐτὸν διὰ τῆς θαλάσσης εἰς Κιλικίαν καὶ παρελθὼν εἰς τὸ Κωρύκιον ἄντρον κατέθετο. ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ τὰ νεῦρα κρύψας ἐν ἄρκτου δορᾷ κεῖθι ἀπέθετο, καὶ κατέστησε φύλακα Δελφύνην δράκαιναν: ἡμίθηρ δὲ ἦν αὕτη ἡ κόρη. Ἑρμῆς δὲ καὶ Αἰγίπαν ἐκκλέψαντες τὰ νεῦρα ἥρμοσαν τῷ Διὶ λαθόντες. Ζεὺς δὲ τὴν ἰδίαν ἀνακομισάμενος ἰσχύν, ἐξαίφνης ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ἐπὶ πτηνῶν ὀχούμενος ἵππων ἅρματι, βάλλων κεραυνοῖς ἐπ᾽ ὄρος ἐδίωξε Τυφῶνα τὸ λεγόμενον Νῦσαν, ὅπου μοῖραι αὐτὸν διωχθέντα ἠπάτησαν: πεισθεὶς γὰρ ὅτι ῥωσθήσεται μᾶλλον, ἐγεύσατο τῶν ἐφημέρων καρπῶν. διόπερ ἐπιδιωκόμενος αὖθις ἧκεν εἰς Θρᾴκην, καὶ μαχόμενος περὶ τὸν Αἷμον ὅλα ἔβαλλεν ὄρη. τούτων δὲ ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν ὑπὸ τοῦ κεραυνοῦ πάλιν ὠθουμένων πολὺ ἐπὶ τοῦ ὄρους ἐξέκλυσεν αἷμα: καί φασιν ἐκ τούτου τὸ ὄρος κληθῆναι Αἷμον. φεύγειν δὲ ὁρμηθέντι αὐτῷ διὰ τῆς Σικελικῆς θαλάσσης Ζεὺς ἐπέρριψεν Αἴτνην ὄρος ἐν Σικελίᾳ: τοῦτο δὲ ὑπερμέγεθές ἐστιν, ἐξ οὗ μέχρι δεῦρό φασιν ἀπὸ τῶν βληθέντων κεραυνῶν γίνεσθαι πυρὸς ἀναφυσήματα. ἀλλὰ περὶ μὲν τούτων μέχρι τοῦ δεῦρο ἡμῖν λελέχθω.

[3] When the gods had overcome the giants, Earth, still more enraged, had intercourse with Tartarus and brought forth Typhon in Cilicia, a hybrid between man and beast. In size and strength he surpassed all the offspring of Earth. As far as the thighs he was of human shape and of such prodigious bulk that he out-topped all the mountains, and his head often brushed the stars. One of his hands reached out to the west and the other to the east, and from them projected a hundred dragons’ heads. From the thighs downward he had huge coils of vipers, which when drawn out, reached to his very head and emitted a loud hissing. His body was all winged:unkempt hair streamed on the wind from his head and cheeks; and fire flashed from his eyes. Such and so great was Typhon when, hurling kindled rocks, he made for the very heaven with hissings and shouts, spouting a great jet of fire from his mouth. But when the gods saw him rushing at heaven, they made for Egypt in flight, and being pursued they changed their forms into those of animals. However Zeus pelted Typhon at a distance with thunderbolts, and at close quarters struck him down with an adamantine sickle, and as he fled pursued him closely as far as Mount Casius, which overhangs Syria. There, seeing the monster sore wounded, he grappled with him. But Typhon twined about him and gripped him in his coils, and wresting the sickle from him severed the sinews of his hands and feet, and lifting him on his shoulders carried him through the sea to Cilicia and deposited him on arrival in the Corycian cave. Likewise he put away the sinews there also, hidden in a bearskin, and he set to guard them the she-dragon Delphyne, who was a half-bestial maiden. But Hermes and Aegipan stole the sinews and fitted them unobserved to Zeus. And having recovered his strength Zeus suddenly from heaven, riding in a chariot of winged horses, pelted Typhon with thunderbolts and pursued him to the mountain called Nysa, where the Fates beguiled the fugitive; for he tasted of the ephemeral fruits in the persuasion that he would be strengthened thereby. So being again pursued he came to Thrace, and in fighting at Mount Haemus he heaved whole mountains. But when these recoiled on him through the force of the thunderbolt, a stream of blood gushed out on the mountain, and they say that from that circumstance the mountain was called Haemus. And when he started to flee through the Sicilian sea, Zeus cast Mount Etna in Sicily upon him. That is a huge mountain, from which down to this day they say that blasts of fire issue from the thunderbolts that were thrown. So much for that subject.

### CHAPTER VII

[1] Προμηθεὺς δὲ ἐξ ὕδατος καὶ γῆς ἀνθρώπους πλάσας ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς καὶ πῦρ, λάθρᾳ Διὸς ἐν νάρθηκι κρύψας. ὡς δὲ ᾔσθετο Ζεύς, ἐπέταξεν Ἡφαίστῳ τῷ Καυκάσῳ ὄρει τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ προσηλῶσαι: τοῦτο δὲ Σκυθικὸν ὄρος ἐστίν. ἐν δὴ τούτῳ προσηλωθεὶς Προμηθεὺς πολλῶν ἐτῶν ἀριθμὸν ἐδέδετο: καθ᾽ ἑκάστην δὲ ἡμέραν ἀετὸς ἐφιπτάμενος αὐτῷ τοὺς λοβοὺς ἐνέμετο τοῦ ἥπατος αὐξανομένου διὰ νυκτός. καὶ Προμηθεὺς μὲν πυρὸς κλαπέντος δίκην ἔτινε ταύτην, μέχρις Ἡρακλῆς αὐτὸν ὕστερον ἔλυσεν, ὡς ἐν τοῖς καθ᾽ Ἡρακλέα δηλώσομεν.

[1] Prometheus moulded men out of water and earth and gave them also fire, which, unknown to Zeus, he had hidden in a stalk of fennel. But when Zeus learned of it, he ordered Hephaestus to nail his body to Mount Caucasus, which is a Scythian mountain. On it Prometheus was nailed and kept bound for many years. Every day an eagle swooped on him and devoured the lobes of his liver, which grew by night. That was the penalty that Prometheus paid for the theft of fire until Hercules afterwards released him, as we shall show in dealing with Hercules.

[2] Προμηθέως δὲ παῖς Δευκαλίων ἐγένετο. οὗτος βασιλεύων τῶν περὶ τὴν Φθίαν τόπων γαμεῖ Πύρραν τὴν Ἐπιμηθέως καὶ Πανδώρας, ἣν ἔπλασαν θεοὶ πρώτην γυναῖκα. ἐπεὶ δὲ ἀφανίσαι Ζεὺς τὸ χαλκοῦν ἠθέλησε γένος, ὑποθεμένου Προμηθέως Δευκαλίων τεκτηνάμενος λάρνακα, καὶ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἐνθέμενος, εἰς ταύτην μετὰ Πύρρας εἰσέβη. Ζεὺς δὲ πολὺν ὑετὸν ἀπ᾽ οὐρανοῦ χέας τὰ πλεῖστα μέρη τῆς Ἑλλάδος κατέκλυσεν, ὥστε διαφθαρῆναι πάντας ἀνθρώπους, ὀλίγων χωρὶς οἳ συνέφυγον εἰς τὰ πλησίον ὑψηλὰ ὄρη. τότε δὲ καὶ τὰ κατὰ Θεσσαλίαν ὄρη διέστη, καὶ τὰ ἐκτὸς Ἰσθμοῦ καὶ Πελοποννήσου συνεχέθη πάντα. Δευκαλίων δὲ ἐν τῇ λάρνακι διὰ τῆς θαλάσσης φερόμενος ἐφ᾽ ἡμέρας ἐννέα καὶ νύκτας τὰς ἴσας τῷ Παρνασῷ προσίσχει, κἀκεῖ τῶν ὄμβρων παῦλαν λαβόντων ἐκβὰς θύει Διὶ φυξίῳ. Ζεὺς δὲ πέμψας Ἑρμῆν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐπέτρεψεν αἱρεῖσθαι ὅ τι βούλεται: ὁ δὲ αἱρεῖται ἀνθρώπους αὐτῷ γενέσθαι. καὶ Διὸς εἰπόντος ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς ἔβαλλεν αἴρων λίθους, καὶ οὓς μὲν ἔβαλε Δευκαλίων, ἄνδρες ἐγένοντο, οὓς δὲ Πύρρα, γυναῖκες. ὅθεν καὶ λαοὶ μεταφορικῶς ὠνομάσθησαν ἀπὸ τοῦ λᾶας ὁ λίθος.γίνονται δὲ ἐκ Πύρρας Δευκαλίωνι παῖδες Ἕλλην μὲν πρῶτος, ὃν ἐκ Διὸς γεγεννῆσθαι ἔνιοι λέγουσι, δεύτερος δὲ Ἀμφικτύων ὁ μετὰ Κραναὸν βασιλεύσας τῆς Ἀττικῆς, θυγάτηρ δὲ Πρωτογένεια, ἐξ ἧς καὶ Διὸς Ἀέθλιος.

[2] And Prometheus had a son Deucalion. He reigning in the regions about Phthia, married Pyrrha, the daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora, the first woman fashioned by the gods. And when Zeus would destroy the men of the Bronze Age, Deucalion by the advice of Prometheus constructed a chest, and having stored it with provisions he embarked in it with Pyrrha. But Zeus by pouring heavy rain from heaven flooded the greater part of Greece, so that all men were destroyed, except a few who fled to the high mountains in the neighborhood. It was then that the mountains in Thessaly parted, and that all the world outside the Isthmus and Peloponnese was overwhelmed. But Deucalion, floating in the chest over the sea for nine days and as many nights, drifted to Parnassus, and there, when the rain ceased, he landed and sacrificed to Zeus, the god of Escape. And Zeus sent Hermes to him and allowed him to choose what he would, and he chose to get men. And at the bidding of Zeus he took up stones and threw them over his head, and the stones which Deucalion threw became men, and the stones which Pyrrha threw became women. Hence people were called metaphorically people （ laos） from laas, “ a stone. “ And Deucalion had children by Pyrrha, first Hellen, whose father some say was Zeus, and second Amphictyon, who reigned over Attica after Cranaus; and third a daughter Protogenia, who became the mother of Aethlius by Zeus.

[3] Ἕλληνος δὲ καὶ νύμφης Ὀρσηίδος Δῶρος Ξοῦθος Αἴολος. αὐτὸς μὲν οὖν ἀφ᾽ αὑτοῦ τοὺς καλουμένους Γραικοὺς προσηγόρευσεν Ἕλληνας, τοῖς δὲ παισὶν ἐμέρισε τὴν χώραν: καὶ Ξοῦθος μὲν λαβὼν τὴν Πελοπόννησον ἐκ Κρεούσης τῆς Ἐρεχθέως Ἀχαιὸν ἐγέννησε καὶ Ἴωνα, ἀφ᾽ ὧν Ἀχαιοὶ καὶ Ἴωνες καλοῦνται, Δῶρος δὲ τὴν πέραν χώραν Πελοποννήσου λαβὼν τοὺς κατοίκους ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ Δωριεῖς ἐκάλεσεν, Αἴολος δὲ βασιλεύων τῶν περὶ τὴν Θεσσαλίαν τόπων τοὺς ἐνοικοῦντας Αἰολεῖς προσηγόρευσε, καὶ γήμας Ἐναρέτην τὴν Δηιμάχου παῖδας μὲν ἐγέννησεν ἑπτά, Κρηθέα Σίσυφον Ἀθάμαντα Σαλμωνέα Δηιόνα Μάγνητα Περιήρην, θυγατέρας δὲ πέντε, Κανάκην Ἀλκυόνην Πεισιδίκην Καλύκην Περιμήδην.Περιμήδης μὲν οὖν καὶ Ἀχελῴου Ἱπποδάμας καὶ Ὀρέστης, Πεισιδίκης δὲ καὶ Μυρμιδόνος Ἄντιφος καὶ Ἄκτωρ.

[3] Hellen had Dorus, Xuthus, and Aeolus by a nymph Orseis. Those who were called Greeks he named Hellenes after himself, and divided the country among his sons. Xuthus received Peloponnese and begat Achaeus and Ion by Creusa, daughter of Erechtheus, and from Achaeus and Ion the Achaeans and Ionians derive their names. Dorus received the country over against Peloponnese and called the settlers Dorians after himself. Aeolus reigned over the regions about Thessaly and named the inhabitants Aeolians. He married Enarete, daughter of Deimachus, and begat seven sons, Cretheus, Sisyphus, Athamas, Salmoneus, Deion, Magnes, Perieres, and five daughters, Canace, Alcyone, Pisidice, Calyce, Perimede.Perimede had Hippodamas and Orestes by Achelous; and Pisidice had Antiphus and Actor by Myrmidon.

[4] Ἀλκυόνην δὲ Κῆυξ ἔγημεν Ἑωσφόρου παῖς. οὗτοι δὲ δι᾽ ὑπερηφάνειαν ἀπώλοντο: ὁ μὲν γὰρ τὴν γυναῖκα ἔλεγεν Ἥραν, ἡ δὲ τὸν ἄνδρα Δία, Ζεὺς δὲ αὐτοὺς ἀπωρνέωσε, καὶ τὴν μὲν ἀλκυόνα ἐποίησε τὸν δὲ κήυκα.Κανάκη δὲ ἐγέννησεν ἐκ Ποσειδῶνος Ὁπλέα καὶ Νιρέα καὶ Ἐπωπέα καὶ Ἀλωέα καὶ Τρίοπα. Ἀλωεὺς μὲν οὖν ἔγημεν Ἰφιμέδειαν τὴν Τρίοπος, ἥτις Ποσειδῶνος ἠράσθη, καὶ συνεχῶς φοιτῶσα ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν, χερσὶν ἀρυομένη τὰ κύματα τοῖς κόλποις ἐνεφόρει. συνελθὼν δὲ αὐτῇ Ποσειδῶν δύο ἐγέννησε παῖδας, Ὦτον καὶ Ἐφιάλτην, τοὺς Ἀλωάδας λεγομένους. οὗτοι κατ᾽ ἐνιαυτὸν ηὔξανον πλάτος μὲν πηχυαῖον μῆκος δὲ ὀργυιαῖον: ἐννέα δὲ ἐτῶν γενόμενοι, καὶ τὸ μὲν πλάτος πηχῶν ἔχοντες ἐννέα τὸ δὲ μέγεθος ὀργυιῶν ἐννέα, πρὸς θεοὺς μάχεσθαι διενοοῦντο, καὶ τὴν μὲν Ὄσσαν ἐπὶ τὸν Ὄλυμπον ἔθεσαν, ἐπὶ δὲ τὴν Ὄσσαν θέντες τὸ Πήλιον διὰ τῶν ὀρῶν τούτων ἠπείλουν εἰς οὐρανὸν ἀναβήσεσθαι, καὶ τὴν μὲν θάλασσαν χώσαντες τοῖς ὄρεσι ποιήσειν ἔλεγον ἤπειρον, τὴν δὲ γῆν θάλασσαν, ἐμνῶντο δὲ Ἐφιάλτης μὲν Ἥραν Ὦτος δὲ Ἄρτεμιν. ἔδησαν δὲ καὶ Ἄρην. τοῦτον μὲν οὖν Ἑρμῆς ἐξέκλεψεν, ἀνεῖλε δὲ τοὺς Ἀλωάδας ἐν Νάξῳ Ἄρτεμις δι᾽ ἀπάτης: ἀλλάξασα γὰρ τὴν ἰδέαν εἰς ἔλαφον διὰ μέσων αὐτῶν ἐπήδησεν, οἱ δὲ βουλόμενοι εὐστοχῆσαι τοῦ θηρίου ἐφ᾽ ἑαυτοὺς ἠκόντισαν.

[4] Alcyone was married by Ceyx, son of Lucifer. These perished by reason of their pride; for he said that his wife was Hera, and she said that her husband was Zeus. But Zeus turned them into birds; her he made a kingfisher （ alcyon） and him a gannet （ ceyx）.Canace had by Poseidon Hopleus and Nireus and Epopeus and Aloeus and Triops. Aloeus wedded Iphimedia, daughter of Triops; but she fell in love with Poseidon, and often going to the sea she would draw up the waves with her hands and pour them into her lap. Poseidon met her and begat two sons, Otus and Ephialtes, who are called the Aloads. These grew every year a cubit in breadth and a fathom in height; and when they were nine years old, being nine cubits broad and nine fathoms high, they resolved to fight against the gods, and they set Ossa on Olympus, and having set Pelion on Ossa they threatened by means of these mountains to ascend up to heaven, and they said that by filling up the sea with the mountains they would make it dry land, and the land they would make sea. And Ephialtes wooed Hera, and Otus wooed Artemis; moreover they put Ares in bonds. However, Hermes rescued Ares by stealth, and Artemis killed the Aloads in Naxos by a ruse. For she changed herself into a deer and leaped between them, and in their eagerness to hit the quarry they threw their darts at each other.

[5] Καλύκης δὲ καὶ Ἀεθλίου παῖς Ἐνδυμίων γίνεται, ὅστις ἐκ Θεσσαλίας Αἰολέας ἀγαγὼν Ἦλιν ᾤκισε. λέγουσι δὲ αὐτόν τινες ἐκ Διὸς γενέσθαι. τούτου κάλλει διενεγκόντος ἠράσθη Σελήνη, Ζεὺς δὲ αὐτῷ δίδωσιν ὃ βούλεται ἑλέσθαι: ὁ δὲ αἱρεῖται κοιμᾶσθαι διὰ παντὸς ἀθάνατος καὶ ἀγήρως μένων.

[5] Calyce and Aethlius had a son Endymion who led Aeolians from Thessaly and founded Elis. But some say that he was a son of Zeus. As he was of surpassing beauty, the Moon fell in love with him, and Zeus allowed him to choose what he would, and he chose to sleep for ever, remaining deathless and ageless.

[6] Ἐνδυμίωνος δὲ καὶ νηίδος νύμφης, ἢ ὥς τινες Ἰφιανάσσης, Αἰτωλός, ὃς ἀποκτείνας Ἆπιν τὸν Φορωνέως καὶ φυγὼν εἰς τὴν Κουρήτιδα χώραν, κτείνας τοὺς ὑποδεξαμένους Φθίας καὶ Ἀπόλλωνος υἱούς, Δῶρον καὶ Λαόδοκον καὶ Πολυποίτην, ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ τὴν χώραν Αἰτωλίαν ἐκάλεσεν.

[6] Endymion had by a Naiad nymph or, as some say, by Iphianassa, a son Aetolus, who slew Apis, son of Phoroneus, and fled to the Curetian country. There he killed his hosts, Dorus and Laodocus and Polypoetes, the sons of Phthia and Apollo, and called the country Aetolia after himself.

[7] Αἰτωλοῦ δὲ καὶ Προνόης τῆς Φόρβου Πλευρὼν καὶ Καλυδὼν ἐγένοντο, ἀφ᾽ ὧν αἱ ἐν Αἰτωλίᾳ πόλεις ὠνομάσθησαν. Πλευρὼν μὲν οὖν γήμας Ξανθίππην τὴν Δώρου παῖδα ἐγέννησεν Ἀγήνορα, θυγατέρας δὲ Στερόπην καὶ Στρατονίκην καὶ Λαοφόντην: Καλυδῶνος δὲ καὶ Αἰολίας τῆς Ἀμυθάονος Ἐπικάστη καὶ Πρωτογένεια, ἐξ ἧς καὶ Ἄρεος Ὄξυλος. Ἀγήνωρ δὲ ὁ Πλευρῶνος γήμας Ἐπικάστην τὴν Καλυδῶνος ἐγέννησε Πορθάονα καὶ Δημονίκην, ἧς καὶ Ἄρεος Εὔηνος Μῶλος Πύλος Θέστιος.

[7] Aetolus and Pronoe, daughter of Phorbus, had sons, Pleuron and Calydon, after whom the cities in Aetolia were named. Pleuron wedded Xanthippe, daughter of Dorus, and begat a son Agenor, and daughters, Sterope and Stratonice and Laophonte. Calydon and Aeolia, daughter of Amythaon, had daughters, Epicaste and Protogenia, who had Oxylus by Ares. And Agenor, son of Pleuron, married Epicaste, daughter of Calydon, and begat Porthaon and Demonice, who had Evenus, Molus, Pylus, and Thestius by Ares.

[8] Εὔηνος μὲν οὖν ἐγέννησε Μάρπησσαν, ἣν Ἀπόλλωνος μνηστευομένου Ἴδας ὁ Ἀφαρέως ἥρπασε, λαβὼν παρὰ Ποσειδῶνος ἅρμα ὑπόπτερον. διώκων δὲ Εὔηνος ἐφ᾽ ἅρματος ἐπὶ τὸν Λυκόρμαν ἦλθε ποταμόν, καταλαβεῖν δ᾽ οὐ δυνάμενος τοὺς μὲν ἵππους ἀπέσφαξεν, ἑαυτὸν δ᾽ εἰς τὸν ποταμὸν ἔβαλε: καὶ καλεῖται Εὔηνος ὁ ποταμὸς ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνου.

[8] Evenus begat Marpessa, who was wooed by Apollo, but Idas, son of Aphareus, carried her off in a winged chariot which he received from Poseidon. Pursuing him in a chariot, Evenus came to the river Lycormas, but when he could not catch him he slaughtered his horses and threw himself into the river, and the river is called Evenus after him.

[9] Ἴδας δὲ εἰς Μεσσήνην παραγίνεται, καὶ αὐτῷ ὁ Ἀπόλλων περιτυχὼν ἀφαιρεῖται τὴν κόρην. μαχομένων δὲ αὐτῶν περὶ τῶν τῆς παιδὸς γάμων, Ζεὺς διαλύσας ἐπέτρεψεν αὐτῇ τῇ παρθένῳ ἑλέσθαι ὁποτέρῳ βούλεται συνοικεῖν: ἡ δὲ δείσασα, ὡς ἂν μὴ γηρῶσαν αὐτὴν Ἀπόλλων καταλίπῃ, τὸν Ἴδαν εἵλετο ἄνδρα.

[9] But Idas came to Messene, and Apollo, falling in with him, would have robbed him of the damsel. As they fought for the girl’s hand, Zeus parted them and allowed the maiden herself to choose which of the two she would marry; and she, because she feared that Apollo might desert her in her old age, chose Idas for her husband.

[10] Θεστίῳ δὲ ἐξ Εὐρυθέμιδος τῆς Κλεοβοίας ἐγένοντο θυγατέρες μὲν Ἀλθαία Λήδα Ὑπερμνήστρα, ἄρρενες δὲ Ἴφικλος Εὔιππος Πλήξιππος Εὐρύπυλος.Πορθάονος δὲ καὶ Εὐρύτης τῆς Ἱπποδάμαντος ἐγένοντο παῖδες Οἰνεὺς Ἄγριος Ἀλκάθοος Μέλας Λευκωπεύς, θυγάτηρ δὲ Στερόπη, ἐξ ἧς καὶ Ἀχελῴου Σειρῆνας γενέσθαι λέγουσιν.

[10] Thestius had daughters and sons by Eurythemis, daughter of Cleoboea: the daughters were Althaea, Leda, Hypermnestra, and the males were Iphiclus, Evippus, Plexippus, and Eurypylus.Porthaon and Euryte, daughter of Hippodamas, had sons, Oeneus, Agrius, Alcathous, Melas, Leucopeus, and a daughter Sterope, who is said to have been the mother of the Sirens by Achelous.

### CHAPTER VIII

[1] Οἰνεὺς δὲ βασιλεύων Καλυδῶνος παρὰ Διονύσου φυτὸν ἀμπέλου πρῶτος ἔλαβε. γήμας δὲ Ἀλθαίαν τὴν Θεστίου γεννᾷ Τοξέα, ὃν αὐτὸς ἔκτεινεν ὑπερπηδήσαντα τὴν τάφρον, καὶ παρὰ τοῦτον Θυρέα καὶ Κλύμενον, καὶ θυγατέρα Γόργην, ἣν Ἀνδραίμων ἔγημε, καὶ Δηιάνειραν, ἣν Ἀλθαίαν λέγουσιν ἐκ Διονύσου γεννῆσαι. αὕτη δ᾽ ἡνιόχει καὶ τὰ κατὰ πόλεμον ἤσκει, καὶ περὶ τῶν γάμων αὐτῆς Ἡρακλῆς πρὸς Ἀχελῷον ἐπάλαισεν.

[1] Reigning over Calydon, Oeneus was the first who received a vine-plant from Dionysus. He married Althaea, daughter of Thestius, and begat Toxeus, whom he slew with his own hand because he leaped over the ditch. And besides Toxeus he had Thyreus and Clymenus, and a daughter Gorge, whom Andraemon married, and another daughter Deianira, who is said to have been begotten on Althaea by Dionysus. This Deianira drove a chariot and practised the art of war, and Hercules wrestled for her hand with Achelous.

[2] ἐγέννησε δὲ Ἀλθαία παῖδα ἐξ Οἰνέως Μελέαγρον, ὃν ἐξ Ἄρεος γεγεννῆσθαί φασι. τούτου δ᾽ ὄντος ἡμερῶν ἑπτὰ παραγενομένας τὰς μοίρας φασὶν εἰπεῖν, ὅτι τότε τελευτήσει Μελέαγρος, ὅταν ὁ καιόμενος ἐπὶ τῆς ἐσχάρας δαλὸς κατακαῇ. τοῦτο ἀκούσασα τὸν δαλὸν ἀνείλετο Ἀλθαία καὶ κατέθετο εἰς λάρνακα. Μελέαγρος δὲ ἀνὴρ ἄτρωτος καὶ γενναῖος γενόμενος τόνδε τὸν τρόπον ἐτελεύτησεν. ἐτησίων καρπῶν ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ γενομένων τὰς ἀπαρχὰς Οἰνεὺς θεοῖς πᾶσι θύων μόνης Ἀρτέμιδος ἐξελάθετο. ἡ δὲ μηνίσασα κάπρον ἐφῆκεν ἔξοχον μεγέθει τε καὶ ῥώμῃ, ὃς τήν τε γῆν ἄσπορον ἐτίθει καὶ τὰ βοσκήματα καὶ τοὺς ἐντυγχάνοντας διέφθειρεν. ἐπὶ τοῦτον τὸν κάπρον τοὺς ἀρίστους ἐκ τῆς Ἑλλάδος πάντας συνεκάλεσε, καὶ τῷ κτείναντι τὸν θῆρα τὴν δορὰν δώσειν ἀριστεῖον ἐπηγγείλατο. οἱ δὲ συνελθόντες ἐπὶ τὴν τοῦ κάπρου θήραν ἦσαν οἵδε: Μελέαγρος Οἰνέως, Δρύας Ἄρεος, ἐκ Καλυδῶνος οὗτοι, Ἴδας καὶ Λυγκεὺς Ἀφαρέως ἐκ Μεσσήνης, Κάστωρ καὶ Πολυδεύκης Διὸς καὶ Λήδας ἐκ Λακεδαίμονος, Θησεὺς Αἰγέως ἐξ Ἀθηνῶν, Ἄδμητος Φέρητος ἐκ Φερῶν, Ἀγκαῖος καὶ Κηφεὺς Λυκούργου ἐξ Ἀρκαδίας, Ἰάσων Αἴσονος ἐξ Ἰωλκοῦ, Ἰφικλῆς Ἀμφιτρύωνος ἐκ Θηβῶν, Πειρίθους Ἰξίονος ἐκ Λαρίσης, Πηλεὺς Αἰακοῦ ἐκ Φθίας, Τελαμὼν Αἰακοῦ ἐκ Σαλαμῖνος, Εὐρυτίων Ἄκτορος ἐκ Φθίας, Ἀταλάντη Σχοινέως ἐξ Ἀρκαδίας, Ἀμφιάραος Ὀικλέους ἐξ Ἄργους: μετὰ τούτων καὶ οἱ Θεστίου παῖδες. συνελθόντας δὲ αὐτοὺς Οἰνεὺς ἐπὶ ἐννέα ἡμέρας ἐξένισε: τῇ δεκάτῃ δὲ Κηφέως καὶ Ἀγκαίου καί τινων ἄλλων ἀπαξιούντων μετὰ γυναικὸς ἐπὶ τὴν θήραν ἐξιέναι, Μελέαγρος ἔχων γυναῖκα Κλεοπάτραν τὴν Ἴδα καὶ Μαρπήσσης θυγατέρα, βουλόμενος δὲ καὶ ἐξ Ἀταλάντης τεκνοποιήσασθαι, συνηνάγκασεν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὴν θήραν μετὰ ταύτης ἐξιέναι. περιστάντων δὲ αὐτῶν τὸν κάπρον, Ὑλεὺς μὲν καὶ Ἀγκαῖος ὑπὸ τοῦ θηρὸς διεφθάρησαν, Εὐρυτίωνα δὲ Πηλεὺς ἄκων κατηκόντισε. τὸν δὲ κάπρον πρώτη μὲν Ἀταλάντη εἰς τὰ νῶτα ἐτόξευσε, δεύτερος δὲ Ἀμφιάραος εἰς τὸν ὀφθαλμόν: Μελέαγρος δὲ αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν κενεῶνα πλήξας ἀπέκτεινε, καὶ λαβὼν τὸ δέρας ἔδωκεν Ἀταλάντῃ. οἱ δὲ Θεστίου παῖδες, ἀδοξοῦντες εἰ παρόντων ἀνδρῶν γυνὴ τὰ ἀριστεῖα λήψεται, τὸ δέρας αὐτῆς ἀφείλοντο, κατὰ γένος αὑτοῖς προσήκειν λέγοντες, εἰ Μελέαγρος λαμβάνειν μὴ προαιροῖτο.

[2] Althaea had also a son Meleager, by Oeneus, though they say that he was begotten by Ares. It is said that, when he was seven days old, the Fates came and declared that Meleager should die when the brand burning on the hearth was burnt out. On hearing that, Althaea snatched up the brand and deposited it in a chest. Meleager grew up to be an invulnerable and gallant man, but came by his end in the following way. In sacrificing the first fruits of the annual crops of the country to all the gods Oeneus forgot Artemis alone. But she in her wrath sent a boar of extraordinary size and strength, which prevented the land from being sown and destroyed the cattle and the people that fell in with it. To attack this boar Oeneus called together all the noblest men of Greece, and promised that to him who should kill the beast he would give the skin as a prize. Now the men who assembled to hunt the boar were these: — Meleager, son of Oeneus; Dryas, son of Ares; these came from Calydon; Idas and Lynceus, sons of Aphareus, from Messene; Castor and Pollux, sons of Zeus and Leda, from Lacedaemon; Theseus, son of Aegeus, from Athens; Admetus, son of Pheres, from Pherae; Ancaeus and Cepheus, sons of Lycurgus, from Arcadia; Jason, son of Aeson, from Iolcus; Iphicles, son of Amphitryon, from Thebes; Pirithous, son of Ixion, from Larissa; Peleus, son of Aeacus, from Phthia; Telamon, son of Aeacus, from Salamis; Eurytion, son of Actor, from Phthia; Atalanta, daughter of Schoeneus, from Arcadia; Amphiaraus, son of Oicles, from Argos. With them came also the sons of Thestius. And when they were assembled, Oeneus entertained them for nine days; but on the tenth, when Cepheus and Ancaeus and some others disdained to go hunting with a woman, Meleager compelled them to follow the chase with her, for he desired to have a child also by Atalanta, though he had to wife Cleopatra, daughter of Idas and Marpessa. When they surrounded the boar, Hyleus and Ancaeus were killed by the brute, and Peleus struck down Eurytion undesignedly with a javelin. But Atalanta was the first to shoot the boar in the back with an arrow, and Amphiaraus was the next to shoot it in the eye; but Meleager killed it by a stab in the flank, and on receiving the skin gave it to Atalanta. Nevertheless the sons of Thestius, thinking scorn that a woman should get the prize in the face of men, took the skin from her, alleging that it belonged to them by right of birth if Meleager did not choose to take it.

[3] ὀργισθεὶς δὲ Μελέαγρος τοὺς μὲν Θεστίου παῖδας ἀπέκτεινε, τὸ δὲ δέρας ἔδωκε τῇ Ἀταλάντῃ. Ἀλθαία δὲ λυπηθεῖσα ἐπὶ τῇ τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἀπωλείᾳ τὸν δαλὸν ἧψε, καὶ ὁ Μελέαγρος ἐξαίφνης ἀπέθανεν.οἱ δέ φασιν οὐχ οὕτω Μελέαγρον τελευτῆσαι, ἀμφισβητούντων δὲ τῆς δορᾶς τῶν Θεστίου παίδων ὡς Ἰφίκλου πρώτου βαλόντος, Κούρησι καὶ Καλυδωνίοις πόλεμον ἐνστῆναι, ἐξελθόντος δὲ Μελεάγρου καί τινας τῶν Θεστίου παίδων φονεύσαντος Ἀλθαίαν ἀράσασθαι κατ᾽ αὐτοῦ: τὸν δὲ ὀργιζόμενον οἴκοι μένειν. ἤδη δὲ τῶν πολεμίων τοῖς τείχεσι προσπελαζόντων καὶ τῶν πολιτῶν ἀξιούντων μεθ᾽ ἱκετηρίας βοηθεῖν, μόλις πεισθέντα ὑπὸ τῆς γυναικὸς ἐξελθεῖν, καὶ τοὺς λοιποὺς κτείναντα τῶν Θεστίου παίδων ἀποθανεῖν μαχόμενον. μετὰ δὲ τὸν Μελεάγρου θάνατον Ἀλθαία καὶ Κλεοπάτρα ἑαυτὰς ἀνήρτησαν, αἱ δὲ θρηνοῦσαι τὸν νεκρὸν γυναῖκες ἀπωρνεώθησαν.

[3] But Meleager in a rage slew the sons of Thestius and gave the skin to Atalanta. However, from grief at the slaughter of her brothers Althaea kindled the brand, and Meleager immediately expired.But some say that Meleager did not die in that way, but that when the sons of Thestius claimed the skin on the ground that Iphiclus had been the first to hit the boar, war broke out between the Curetes and the Calydonians; and when Meleager had sallied out and slain some of the sons of Thestius, Althaea cursed him, and he in a rage remained at home; however, when the enemy approached the walls, and the citizens supplicated him to come to the rescue, he yielded reluctantly to his wife and sallied forth, and having killed the rest of the sons of Thestius, he himself fell fighting. After the death of Meleager, Althaea and Cleopatra hanged themselves, and the women who mourned the dead man were turned into birds.

[4] Ἀλθαίας δὲ ἀποθανούσης ἔγημεν Οἰνεὺς Περίβοιαν τὴν Ἱππονόου. ταύτην δὲ ὁ μὲν γράψας τὴν Θηβαΐδα πολεμηθείσης Ὠλένου λέγει λαβεῖν Οἰνέα γέρας, Ἡσίοδος δὲ ἐξ Ὠλένου τῆς Ἀχαΐας, ἐφθαρμένην ὑπὸ Ἱπποστράτου τοῦ Ἀμαρυγκέως, Ἱππόνουν τὸν πατέρα πέμψαι πρὸς Οἰνέα πόρρω τῆς Ἑλλάδος ὄντα, ἐντειλάμενον ἀποκτεῖναι.

[4] After Althaea’s death Oeneus married Periboea, daughter of Hipponous. The author of the Thebaid says that when Olenus was sacked, Oeneus received Periboea as a gift of honor; but Hesiod says that she was seduced by Hippostratus, son of Amarynceus, and that her father Hipponous sent her away from Olenus in Achaia to Oeneus, because he dwelt far from Greece, with an injunction to put her to death.

[5] εἰσὶ δὲ οἱ λέγοντες Ἱππόνουν ἐπιγνόντα τὴν ἰδίαν θυγατέρα ἐφθαρμένην ὑπὸ Οἰνέως, ἔγκυον αὐτὴν πρὸς τοῦτον ἀποπέμψαι. ἐγεννήθη δὲ ἐκ ταύτης Οἰνεῖ Τυδεύς. Πείσανδρος δὲ αὐτὸν ἐκ Γόργης γενέσθαι λέγει: τῆς γὰρ θυγατρὸς Οἰνέα κατὰ τὴν βούλησιν Διὸς ἐρασθῆναι.Τυδεὺς δὲ ἀνὴρ γενόμενος γενναῖος ἐφυγαδεύθη, κτείνας, ὡς μέν τινες λέγουσιν, ἀδελφὸν Οἰνέως Ἀλκάθοον, ὡς δὲ ὁ τὴν Ἀλκμαιωνίδα γεγραφώς, τοὺς Μέλανος παῖδας ἐπιβουλεύοντας Οἰνεῖ, Φηνέα Εὐρύαλον Ὑπέρλαον Ἀντίοχον Εὐμήδην Στέρνοπα Ξάνθιππον Σθενέλαον, ὡς δὲ Φερεκύδης φησίν, Ὠλενίαν ἀδελφὸν ἴδιον. Ἀγρίου δὲ δίκας ἐπάγοντος αὐτῷ φυγὼν εἰς Ἄργος ἧκε πρὸς Ἄδραστον, καὶ τὴν τούτου γήμας θυγατέρα Δηιπύλην ἐγέννησε Διομήδην.Τυδεὺς μὲν οὖν ἐπὶ Θήβας μετ᾽ Ἀδράστου στρατευσάμενος ὑπὸ Μελανίππου τρωθεὶς ἀπέθανεν:

[5] However, some say that Hipponous discovered that his daughter had been debauched by Oeneus, and therefore he sent her away to him when she was with child. By her Oeneus begat Tydeus. But Pisander says that the mother of Tydeus was Gorge, for Zeus willed it that Oeneus should fall in love with his own daughter.When Tydeus had grown to be a gallant man he was banished for killing, as some say, Alcathous, brother of Oeneus; but according to the author of the Alcmaeonidhis victims were the sons of Melas who had plotted against Oeneus, their names being Pheneus, Euryalus, Hyperlaus, Antiochus, Eumedes, Sternops, Xanthippus, Sthenelaus; but as Pherecydes will have it, he murdered his own brother Olenias. Being arraigned by Agrius, he fled to Argos and came to Adrastus, whose daughter Deipyle he married and begat Diomedes.Tydeus marched against Thebes with Adrastus, and died of a wound which he received at the hand of Melanippus.

[6] οἱ δὲ Ἀγρίου παῖδες, Θερσίτης Ὀγχηστὸς Πρόθοος Κελεύτωρ Λυκωπεὺς Μελάνιππος, ἀφελόμενοι τὴν Οἰνέως βασιλείαν τῷ πατρὶ ἔδοσαν, καὶ προσέτι ζῶντα τὸν Οἰνέα καθείρξαντες ᾐκίζοντο. ὕστερον δὲ Διομήδης ἐξ Ἄργους παραγενόμενος μετ᾽ Ἀλκμαίωνος κρύφα τοὺς μὲν Ἀγρίου παῖδας, χωρὶς Ὀγχηστοῦ καὶ Θερσίτου, πάντας ἀπέκτεινεν （οὗτοι γὰρ φθάσαντες εἰς Πελοπόννησον ἔφυγον）, τὴν δὲ βασιλείαν, ἐπειδὴ γηραιὸς ἦν ὁ Οἰνεύς, Ἀνδραίμονι τῷ τὴν θυγατέρα τοῦ Οἰνέως γήμαντι δέδωκε, τὸν δὲ Οἰνέα εἰς Πελοπόννησον ἦγεν. οἱ δὲ διαφυγόντες Ἀγρίου παῖδες ἐνεδρεύσαντες περὶ τὴν Τηλέφου ἑστίαν τῆς Ἀρκαδίας τὸν πρεσβύτην ἀπέκτειναν. Διομήδης δὲ τὸν νεκρὸν εἰς Ἄργος κομίσας ἔθαψεν ἔνθα νῦν πόλις ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνου Οἰνόη καλεῖται, καὶ γήμας Αἰγιάλειαν τὴν Ἀδράστου, ἢ ὡς ἔνιοι φασι τὴν Αἰγιαλέως, ἐπί τε Θήβας καὶ Τροίαν ἐστράτευσε.

[6] But the sons of Agrius, to wit, Thersites, Onchestus, Prothous, Celeutor, Lycopeus, Melanippus, wrested the kingdom from Oeneus and gave it to their father, and more than that they imprisoned Oeneus in his lifetime and tormented him. Nevertheless Diomedes afterwards came secretly with Alcmaeon from Argos and put to death all the sons of Agrius, except Onchestus and Thersites, who had fled betimes to Peloponnese; and as Oeneus was old, Diomedes gave the kingdom to Andraemon who had married the daughter of Oeneus, but Oeneus himself he took with him to Peloponnese. Howbeit, the sons of Agrius, who had made their escape, lay in wait for the old man at the hearth of Telephus in Arcadia, and killed him. But Diomedes conveyed the corpse to Argos and buried him in the place where now a city is called Oenoe after him. And having married Aegialia, daughter of Adrastus or, as some say, of Aegialeus, he went to the wars against Thebes and Troy.

### CHAPTER IX

[1] τῶν δὲ Αἰόλου παίδων Ἀθάμας, Βοιωτίας δυναστεύων, ἐκ Νεφέλης τεκνοῖ παῖδα μὲν Φρίξον θυγατέρα δὲ Ἕλλην. αὖθις δὲ Ἰνὼ γαμεῖ, ἐξ ἧς αὐτῷ Λέαρχος καὶ Μελικέρτης ἐγένοντο. ἐπιβουλεύουσα δὲ Ἰνὼ τοῖς Νεφέλης τέκνοις ἔπεισε τὰς γυναῖκας τὸν πυρὸν φρύγειν. λαμβάνουσαι δὲ κρύφα τῶν ἀνδρῶν τοῦτο ἔπρασσον. γῆ δὲ πεφρυγμένους πυροὺς δεχομένη καρποὺς ἐτησίους οὐκ ἀνεδίδου. διὸ πέμπων ὁ Ἀθάμας εἰς Δελφοὺς ἀπαλλαγὴν ἐπυνθάνετο τῆς ἀφορίας. Ἰνὼ δὲ τοὺς πεμφθέντας ἀνέπεισε λέγειν ὡς εἴη κεχρησμένον παύσεσθαι τὴν ἀκαρπίαν, ἐὰν σφαγῇ Διὶ ὁ Φρίξος. τοῦτο ἀκούσας Ἀθάμας, συναναγκαζόμενος ὑπὸ τῶν τὴν γῆν κατοικούντων, τῷ βωμῷ παρέστησε Φρίξον. Νεφέλη δὲ μετὰ τῆς θυγατρὸς αὐτὸν ἀνήρπασε, καὶ παρ᾽ Ἑρμοῦ λαβοῦσα χρυσόμαλλον κριὸν ἔδωκεν, ὑφ᾽ οὗ φερόμενοι δι᾽ οὐρανοῦ γῆν ὑπερέβησαν καὶ θάλασσαν. ὡς δὲ ἐγένοντο κατὰ τὴν μεταξὺ κειμένην θάλασσαν Σιγείου καὶ Χερρονήσου, ὤλισθεν εἰς τὸν βυθὸν ἡ Ἕλλη, κἀκεῖ θανούσης αὐτῆς ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνης Ἑλλήσποντος ἐκλήθη τὸ πέλαγος. Φρίξος δὲ ἦλθεν εἰς Κόλχους, ὧν Αἰήτης ἐβασίλευε παῖς Ἡλίου καὶ Περσηίδος, ἀδελφὸς δὲ Κίρκης καὶ Πασιφάης, ἣν Μίνως ἔγημεν. οὗτος αὐτὸν ὑποδέχεται, καὶ μίαν τῶν θυγατέρων Χαλκιόπην δίδωσιν. ὁ δὲ τὸν χρυσόμαλλον κριὸν Διὶ θύει φυξίῳ, τὸ δὲ τούτου δέρας Αἰήτῃ δίδωσιν: ἐκεῖνος δὲ αὐτὸ περὶ δρῦν ἐν Ἄρεος ἄλσει καθήλωσεν. ἐγένοντο δὲ ἐκ Χαλκιόπης Φρίξῳ παῖδες Ἄργος Μέλας Φρόντις Κυτίσωρος.

[1] Of the sons of Aeolus, Athamas ruled over Boeotia and begat a son Phrixus and a daughter Helle by Nephele. And he married a second wife, Ino, by whom he had Learchus and Melicertes. But Ino plotted against the children of Nephele and persuaded the women to parch the wheat; and having got the wheat they did so without the knowledge of the men. But the earth, being sown with parched wheat, did not yield its annual crops; so Athamas sent to Delphi to inquire how he might be delivered from the dearth. Now Ino persuaded the messengers to say it was foretold that the infertility would cease if Phrixus were sacrificed to Zeus. When Athamas heard that, he was forced by the inhabitants of the land to bring Phrixus to the altar. But Nephele caught him and her daughter up and gave them a ram with a golden fleece, which she had received from Hermes, and borne through the sky by the ram they crossed land and sea. But when they were over the sea which lies betwixt Sigeum and the Chersonese, Helle slipped into the deep and was drowned, and the sea was called Hellespont after her. But Phrixus came to the Colchians, whose king was Aeetes, son of the Sun and of Perseis, and brother of Circe and Pasiphae, whom Minos married. He received Phrixus and gave him one of his daughters, Chalciope. And Phrixus sacrificed the ram with the golden fleece to Zeus the god of Escape, and the fleece he gave to Aeetes, who nailed it to an oak in a grove of Ares. And Phrixus had children by Chalciope, to wit, Argus, Melas, Phrontis, and Cytisorus.

[2] Ἀθάμας δὲ ὕστερον διὰ μῆνιν Ἥρας καὶ τῶν ἐξ Ἰνοῦς ἐστερήθη παίδων: αὐτὸς μὲν γὰρ μανεὶς ἐτόξευσε Λέαρχον, Ἰνὼ δὲ Μελικέρτην μεθ᾽ ἑαυτῆς εἰς πέλαγος ἔρριψεν. ἐκπεσὼν δὲ τῆς Βοιωτίας ἐπυνθάνετο τοῦ θεοῦ ποῦ κατοικήσει: χρησθέντος δὲ αὐτῷ κατοικεῖν ἐν ᾧπερ ἂν τόπῳ ὑπὸ ζῴων ἀγρίων ξενισθῇ, πολλὴν χώραν διελθὼν ἐνέτυχε λύκοις προβάτων μοίρας νεμομένοις: οἱ δέ, θεωρήσαντες αὐτόν, ἃ διῃροῦντο ἀπολιπόντες ἔφυγον. Ἀθάμας δὲ κτίσας τὴν χώραν Ἀθαμαντίαν ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ προσηγόρευσε, καὶ γήμας Θεμιστὼ τὴν Ὑψέως ἐγέννησε Λεύκωνα Ἐρύθριον Σχοινέα Πτῶον.

[2] But afterwards Athamas was bereft also of the children of Ino through the wrath of Hera; for he went mad and shot Learchus with an arrow, and Ino cast herself and Melicertes into the sea. Being banished from Boeotia, Athamas inquired of the god where he should dwell, and on receiving an oracle that he should dwell in whatever place he should be entertained by wild beasts, he traversed a great extent of country till he fell in with wolves that were devouring pieces of sheep; but when they saw him they abandoned their prey and fled. So Athamas settled in that country and named it Athamantia after himself; and he married Themisto, daughter of Hypseus, and begat Leucon, Erythrius, Schoeneus, and Ptous.

[3] Σίσυφος δὲ ὁ Αἰόλου κτίσας Ἐφύραν τὴν νῦν λεγομένην Κόρινθον γαμεῖ Μερόπην τὴν Ἄτλαντος. ἐξ αὐτῶν παῖς γίνεται Γλαῦκος, ᾧ παῖς Βελλεροφόντης ἐξ Εὐρυμέδης ἐγεννήθη, ὃς ἔκτεινε τὴν πυρίπνουν Χίμαιραν. κολάζεται δὲ Σίσυφος ἐν Ἅιδου πέτρον ταῖς χερσὶ καὶ τῇ κεφαλῇ κυλίων, καὶ τοῦτον ὑπερβάλλειν θέλων: οὗτος δὲ ὠθούμενος ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ ὠθεῖται πάλιν εἰς τοὐπίσω. τίνει δὲ ταύτην τὴν δίκην διὰ τὴν Ἀσωποῦ θυγατέρα Αἴγιναν: ἁρπάσαντα γὰρ αὐτὴν κρύφα Δία Ἀσωπῷ μηνῦσαι ζητοῦντι λέγεται.

[3] And Sisyphus, son of Aeolus, founded Ephyra, which is now called Corinth, and married Merope, daughter of Atlas. They had a son Glaucus, who had by Eurymede a son Bellerophon, who slew the fire breathing Chimera. But Sisyphus is punished in Hades by rolling a stone with his hands and head in the effort to heave it over the top; but push it as he will, it rebounds backward. This punishment he endures for the sake of Aegina, daughter of Asopus; for when Zeus had secretly carried her off, Sisyphus is said to have betrayed the secret to Asopus, who was looking for her.

[4] Δηιὼν δὲ βασιλεύων τῆς Φωκίδος Διομήδην τὴν Ξούθου γαμεῖ, καὶ αὐτῷ γίνεται θυγάτηρ μὲν Ἀστεροδία, παῖδες δὲ Αἰνετὸς Ἄκτωρ Φύλακος Κέφαλος, ὃς γαμεῖ Πρόκριν τὴν Ἐρεχθέως. αὖθις δὲ ἡ Ἠὼς αὐτὸν ἁρπάζει ἐρασθεῖσα.

[4] Deion reigned over Phocis and married Diomede, daughter of Xuthus; and there were born to him a daughter, Asterodia, and sons, Aenetus, Actor, Phylacus, and Cephalus, who married Procris, daughter of Erechtheus. But afterwards Dawn fell in love with him and carried him off.

[5] Περιήρης δὲ Μεσσήνην κατασχὼν Γοργοφόνην τὴν Περσέως ἔγημεν, ἐξ ἧς Ἀφαρεὺς αὐτῷ καὶ Λεύκιππος καὶ Τυνδάρεως ἔτι τε Ἰκάριος παῖδες ἐγένοντο. πολλοὶ δὲ τὸν Περιήρην λέγουσιν οὐκ Αἰόλου παῖδα ἀλλὰ Κυνόρτα τοῦ Ἀμύκλα: διόπερ τὰ περὶ τῶν Περιήρους ἐκγόνων ἐν τῷ Ἀτλαντικῷ γένει δηλώσομεν.

[5] Perieres took possession of Messene and married Gorgophone, daughter of Perseus, by whom he had sons, to wit, Aphareus and Leucippus, and Tyndareus, and also Icarius. But many say that Perieres was not the son of Aeolus but of Cynortas, son of Amyclas; so we shall narrate the history of the descendants of Perieres in dealing with the family of Atlas.

[6] Μάγνης δὲ γαμεῖ νύμφην νηίδα, καὶ γίνονται αὐτῷ παῖδες Πολυδέκτης καὶ Δίκτυς: οὗτοι Σέριφον ᾤκισαν.

[6] Magnes married a Naiad nymph, and sons were born to him, Polydectes and Dictys; these colonized Seriphus.

[7] Σαλμωνεὺς δὲ τὸ μὲν πρῶτον περὶ Θεσσαλίαν κατῴκει, παραγενόμενος δὲ αὖθις εἰς Ἦλιν ἐκεῖ πόλιν ἔκτισεν. ὑβριστὴς δὲ ὢν καὶ τῷ Διὶ ἐξισοῦσθαι θέλων διὰ τὴν ἀσέβειαν ἐκολάσθη: ἔλεγε γὰρ ἑαυτὸν εἶναι Δία, καὶ τὰς ἐκείνου θυσίας ἀφελόμενος ἑαυτῷ προσέτασσε θύειν, καὶ βύρσας μὲν ἐξηραμμένας ἐξ ἅρματος μετὰ λεβήτων χαλκῶν σύρων ἔλεγε βροντᾶν, βάλλων δὲ εἰς οὐρανὸν αἰθομένας λαμπάδας ἔλεγεν ἀστράπτειν. Ζεὺς δὲ αὐτὸν κεραυνώσας τὴν κτισθεῖσαν ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ πόλιν καὶ τοὺς οἰκήτορας ἠφάνισε πάντας.

[7] Salmoneus at first dwelt in Thessaly, but afterwards he came to Elis and there founded a city. And being arrogant and wishful to put himself on an equality with Zeus, he was punished for his impiety; for he said that he was himself Zeus, and he took away the sacrifices of the god and ordered them to be offered to himself; and by dragging dried hides, with bronze kettles, at his chariot, he said that he thundered, and by flinging lighted torches at the sky he said that he lightened. But Zeus struck him with a thunderbolt, and wiped out the city he had founded with all its inhabitants.

[8] Τυρὼ δὲ ἡ Σαλμωνέως θυγάτηρ καὶ Ἀλκιδίκης παρὰ Κρηθεῖ τῷ Σαλμωνέως ἀδελφῷ τρεφομένη ἔρωτα ἴσχει Ἐνιπέως τοῦ ποταμοῦ, καὶ συνεχῶς ἐπὶ τὰ τούτου ῥεῖθρα φοιτῶσα τούτοις ἐπωδύρετο. Ποσειδῶν δὲ εἰκασθεὶς Ἐνιπεῖ συγκατεκλίθη αὐτῇ: ἡ δὲ γεννήσασα κρύφα διδύμους παῖδας ἐκτίθησιν. ἐκκειμένων δὲ τῶν βρεφῶν, παριόντων ἱπποφορβῶν ἵππος μία προσαψαμένη τῇ χηλῇ θατέρου τῶν βρεφῶν πέλιόν τι τοῦ προσώπου μέρος ἐποίησεν. ὁ δὲ ἱπποφορβὸς ἀμφοτέρους τοὺς παῖδας ἀνελόμενος ἔθρεψε, καὶ τὸν μὲν πελιωθέντα Πελίαν ἐκάλεσε, τὸν δὲ ἕτερον Νηλέα. τελειωθέντες δὲ ἀνεγνώρισαν τὴν μητέρα, καὶ τὴν μητρυιὰν ἀπέκτειναν Σιδηρώ: κακουμένην γὰρ γνόντες ὑπ᾽ αὐτῆς τὴν μητέρα ὥρμησαν ἐπ᾽ αὐτήν, ἡ δὲ φθάσασα εἰς τὸ τῆς Ἥρας τέμενος κατέφυγε, Πελίας δὲ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῶν τῶν βωμῶν αὐτὴν κατέσφαξε, καὶ καθόλου διετέλει τὴν Ἥραν ἀτιμάζων.

[8] Now Tyro, daughter of Salmoneus and Alcidice, was brought up by Cretheus, brother of Salmoneus, and conceived a passion for the river Enipeus, and often would she hie to its running waters and utter her plaint to them. But Poseidon in the likeness of Enipeus lay with her, and she secretly gave birth to twin sons, whom she exposed. As the babes lay forlorn, a mare, belonging to some passing horsekeepers, kicked with its hoof one of the two infants and left a livid mark on its face. The horsekeeper took up both the children and reared them; and the one with the livid （pelion） mark he called Pelias, and the other Neleus. When they were grown up, they discovered their mother and killed their stepmother Sidero. For knowing that their mother was ill-used by her, they attacked her, but before they could catch her she had taken refuge in the precinct of Hera. However, Pelias cut her down on the very altars, and ever after he continued to treat Hera with contumely.

[9] ἐστασίασαν δὲ ὕστερον πρὸς ἀλλήλους, καὶ Νηλεὺς μὲν ἐκπεσὼν ἧκεν εἰς Μεσσήνην καὶ Πύλον κτίζει, καὶ γαμεῖ Χλωρίδα τὴν Ἀμφίονος, ἐξ ἧς αὐτῷ γίνεται θυγάτηρ μὲν Πηρώ, ἄρρενες δὲ Ταῦρος Ἀστέριος Πυλάων Δηίμαχος Εὐρύβιος Ἐπίλαος Φράσιος Εὐρυμένης Εὐαγόρας Ἀλάστωρ Νέστωρ Περικλύμενος, ᾧ δὴ καὶ Ποσειδῶν δίδωσι μεταβάλλειν τὰς μορφάς, καὶ μαχόμενος ὅτε Ἡρακλῆς ἐξεπόρθει Πύλον, γινόμενος ὁτὲ μὲν λέων ὁτὲ δὲ ὄφις ὁτὲ δὲ μέλισσα, ὑφ᾽ Ἡρακλέους μετὰ τῶν ἄλλων Νηλέως παίδων ἀπέθανεν. ἐσώθη δὲ Νέστωρ μόνος, ἐπειδὴ παρὰ Γερηνίοις ἐτρέφετο: ὃς γήμας Ἀναξιβίαν τὴν Κρατιέως θυγατέρας μὲν Πεισιδίκην καὶ Πολυκάστην ἐγέννησε, παῖδας δὲ Περσέα Στράτιχον Ἄρητον Ἐχέφρονα Πεισίστρατον Ἀντίλοχον Θρασυμήδην.

[9] But afterwards the brothers fell out, and Neleus, being banished, came to Messene, and founded Pylus, and married Chloris, daughter of Amphion, by whom he had a daughter, Pero, and sons, to wit, Taurus, Asterius, Pylaon, Deimachus, Eurybius, Epilaus, Phrasius, Eurymenes, Evagoras, Alastor, Nestor and Periclymenus, whom Poseidon granted the power of changing his shape. And when Hercules was ravaging Pylus, in the fight Periclymenus turned himself into a lion, a snake, and a bee, but was slain by Hercules with the other sons of Neleus. Nestor alone was saved, because he was brought up among the Gerenians. He married Anaxibia, daughter of Cratieus, and begat daughters, Pisidice and Polycaste, and sons, Perseus, Stratichus, Aretus, Echephron, Pisistratus, Antilochus, and Thrasymedes.

[10] Πελίας δὲ περὶ Θεσσαλίαν κατῴκει, καὶ γήμας Ἀναξιβίαν τὴν Βίαντος, ὡς δὲ ἔνιοι Φυλομάχην τὴν Ἀμφίονος, ἐγέννησε παῖδα μὲν Ἄκαστον, θυγατέρας δὲ Πεισιδίκην Πελόπειαν Ἱπποθόην Ἄλκηστιν.

[10] But Pelias dwelt in Thessaly and married Anaxibia, daughter of Bias, but according to some his wife was Phylomache, daughter of Amphion; and he begat a son, Acastus, and daughters, Pisidice, Pelopia, Hippothoe, and Alcestis.

[11] Κρηθεὺς δὲ κτίσας Ἰωλκὸν γαμεῖ Τυρὼ τὴν Σαλμωνέως, ἐξ ἧς αὐτῷ γίνονται παῖδες Αἴσων Ἀμυθάων Φέρης. Ἀμυθάων μὲν οὖν οἰκῶν Πύλον Εἰδομένην γαμεῖ τὴν Φέρητος, καὶ γίνονται παῖδες αὐτῷ Βίας καὶ Μελάμπους, ὃς ἐπὶ τῶν χωρίων διατελῶν, οὔσης πρὸ τῆς οἰκήσεως αὐτοῦ δρυὸς ἐν ᾗ φωλεὸς ὄφεων ὑπῆρχεν, ἀποκτεινάντων τῶν θεραπόντων τοὺς ὄφεις τὰ μὲν ἑρπετὰ ξύλα συμφορήσας ἔκαυσε, τοὺς δὲ τῶν ὄφεων νεοσσοὺς ἔθρεψεν. οἱ δὲ γενόμενοι τέλειοι παραστάντες αὐτῷ κοιμωμένῳ τῶν ὤμων ἐξ ἑκατέρου τὰς ἀκοὰς ταῖς γλώσσαις ἐξεκάθαιρον. ὁ δὲ ἀναστὰς καὶ γενόμενος περιδεὴς τῶν ὑπερπετομένων ὀρνέων τὰς φωνὰς συνίει, καὶ παρ᾽ ἐκείνων μανθάνων προύλεγε τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τὰ μέλλοντα. προσέλαβε δὲ καὶ τὴν διὰ τῶν ἱερῶν μαντικήν, περὶ δὲ τὸν Ἀλφειὸν συντυχὼν Ἀπόλλωνι τὸ λοιπὸν ἄριστος ἦν μάντις.

[11] Cretheus founded Iolcus and married Tyro, daughter of Salmoneus, by whom he had sons, Aeson, Amythaon, and Pheres. Amythaon dwelt in Pylus and married Idomene, daughter of Pheres, and there were born to him two sons, Bias and Melampus. The latter lived in the country, and before his house there was an oak, in which there was a lair of snakes. His servants killed the snakes, but Melampus gathered wood and burnt the reptiles, and reared the young ones. And when the young were full grown, they stood beside him at each of his shoulders as he slept, and they purged his ears with their tongues. He started up in a great fright, but understood the voices of the birds flying overhead, and from what he learned from them he foretold to men what should come to pass. He acquired besides the art of taking the auspices, and having fallen in with Apollo at the Alpheus he was ever after an excellent soothsayer.

[12] Βίας δὲ ἐμνηστεύετο Πηρὼ τὴν Νηλέως: ὁ δὲ πολλῶν αὐτῷ μνηστευομένων τὴν θυγατέρα δώσειν ἔφη τῷ τὰς Φυλάκου βόας κομίσαντι αὐτῷ. αὗται δὲ ἦσαν ἐν Φυλάκῃ, καὶ κύων ἐφύλασσεν αὐτὰς οὗ οὔτε ἄνθρωπος οὔτε θηρίον πέλας ἐλθεῖν ἠδύνατο. ταύτας ἀδυνατῶν Βίας τὰς βόας κλέψαι παρεκάλει τὸν ἀδελφὸν συλλαβέσθαι. Μελάμπους δὲ ὑπέσχετο, καὶ προεῖπεν ὅτι φωραθήσεται κλέπτων καὶ δεθεὶς ἐνιαυτὸν οὕτω τὰς βόας λήψεται. μετὰ δὲ τὴν ὑπόσχεσιν εἰς Φυλάκην ἀπῄει καί, καθάπερ προεῖπε, φωραθεὶς ἐπὶ τῇ κλοπῇ δέσμιος ἐν οἰκήματι ἐφυλάσσετο. λειπομένου δὲ τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ βραχέος χρόνου, τῶν κατὰ τὸ κρυφαῖον τῆς στέγης σκωλήκων ἀκούει, τοῦ μὲν ἐρωτῶντος πόσον ἤδη μέρος τοῦ δοκοῦ διαβέβρωται, τῶν δὲ ἀποκρινομένων λοιπὸν ἐλάχιστον εἶναι. καὶ ταχέως ἐκέλευσεν αὑτὸν εἰς ἕτερον οἴκημα μεταγαγεῖν, γενομένου δὲ τούτου μετ᾽ οὐ πολὺ συνέπεσε τὸ οἴκημα. θαυμάσας δὲ Φύλακος, καὶ μαθὼν ὅτι ἐστὶ μάντις ἄριστος, λύσας παρεκάλεσεν εἰπεῖν ὅπως αὐτοῦ τῷ παιδὶ Ἰφίκλῳ παῖδες γένωνται. ὁ δὲ ὑπέσχετο ἐφ᾽ ᾧ τὰς βόας λήψεται. καὶ καταθύσας ταύρους δύο καὶ μελίσας τοὺς οἰωνοὺς προσεκαλέσατο: παραγενομένου δὲ αἰγυπιοῦ, παρὰ τούτου μανθάνει δὴ ὅτι Φύλακός ποτε κριοὺς τέμνων ἐπὶ τῶν αἰδοίων παρὰ τῷ Ἰφίκλῳ τὴν μάχαιραν ᾑμαγμένην ἔτι κατέθετο, δείσαντος δὲ τοῦ παιδὸς καὶ φυγόντος αὖθις κατὰ τῆς ἱερᾶς δρυὸς αὐτὴν ἔπηξε, καὶ ταύτην ἀμφιτροχάσας ἐκάλυψεν ὁ φλοιός. ἔλεγεν οὖν, εὑρεθείσης τῆς μαχαίρας εἰ ξύων τὸν ἰὸν ἐπὶ ἡμέρας δέκα Ἰφίκλῳ δῷ πιεῖν, παῖδα γεννήσειν. ταῦτα μαθὼν παρ᾽ αἰγυπιοῦ Μελάμπους τὴν μὲν μάχαιραν εὗρε, τῷ δὲ Ἰφίκλῳ τὸν ἰὸν ξύσας ἐπὶ ἡμέρας δέκα δέδωκε πιεῖν, καὶ παῖς αὐτῷ Ποδάρκης ἐγένετο. τὰς δὲ βόας εἰς Πύλον ἤλασε, καὶ τῷ ἀδελφῷ τὴν Νηλέως θυγατέρα λαβὼν ἔδωκε. καὶ μέχρι μέν τινος ἐν Μεσσήνῃ κατῴκει, ὡς δὲ τὰς ἐν Ἄργει γυναῖκας ἐξέμηνε Διόνυσος, ἐπὶ μέρει τῆς βασιλείας ἰασάμενος αὐτὰς ἐκεῖ μετὰ Βίαντος κατῴκησε.

[12] Bias wooed Pero, daughter of Neleus. But as there were many suitors for his daughter’s hand, Neleus said that he would give her to him who should bring him the kine of Phylacus. These were in Phylace, and they were guarded by a dog which neither man nor beast could come near. Unable to steal these kine, Bias invited his brother to help him. Melampus promised to do so, and foretold that he should be detected in the act of stealing them, and that he should get the kine after being kept in bondage for a year. After making this promise he repaired to Phylace and, just as he had foretold, he was detected in the theft and kept a prisoner in a cell. When the year was nearly up, he heard the worms in the hidden part of the roof, one of them asking how much of the beam had been already gnawed through, and others answering that very little of it was left. At once he bade them transfer him to another cell, and not long after that had been done the cell fell in. Phylacus marvelled, and perceiving that he was an excellent soothsayer, he released him and invited him to say how his son Iphiclus might get children. Melampus promised to tell him, provided he got the kine. And having sacrificed two bulls and cut them in pieces he summoned the birds; and when a vulture came, he learned from it that once, when Phylacus was gelding rams, he laid down the knife, still bloody, beside Iphiclus, and that when the child was frightened and ran away, he stuck the knife on the sacred oak, and the bark encompassed the knife and hid it. He said, therefore, that if the knife were found, and he scraped off the rust, and gave it to Iphiclus to drink for ten days, he would beget a son. Having learned these things from the vulture, Melampus found the knife, scraped the rust, and gave it to Iphiclus for ten days to drink, and a son Podarces was born to him. But he drove the kine to Pylus, and having received the daughter of Neleus he gave her to his brother. For a time he continued to dwell in Messene, but when Dionysus drove the women of Argos mad, he healed them on condition of receiving part of the kingdom, and settled down there with Bias.

[13] Βίαντος δὲ καὶ Πηροῦς Ταλαός, οὗ καὶ Λυσιμάχης τῆς Ἄβαντος τοῦ Μελάμποδος Ἄδραστος Παρθενοπαῖος Πρῶναξ Μηκιστεὺς Ἀριστόμαχος Ἐριφύλη, ἣν Ἀμφιάραος γαμεῖ. Παρθενοπαίου δὲ Πρόμαχος ἐγένετο, ὃς μετὰ τῶν ἐπιγόνων ἐπὶ Θήβας ἐστρατεύθη, Μηκιστέως δὲ Εὐρύαλος, ὃς ἧκεν εἰς Τροίαν. Πρώνακτος δὲ ἐγένετο Λυκοῦργος, Ἀδράστου δὲ καὶ Ἀμφιθέας τῆς Πρώνακτος θυγατέρες μὲν Ἀργεία Δηιπύλη Αἰγιάλεια, παῖδες δὲ Αἰγιαλεὺς καὶ Κυάνιππος.

[13] Bias and Pero had a son Talaus, who married Lysimache, daughter of Abas, son of Melampus, and had by her Adrastus, Parthenopaeus, Pronax, Mecisteus, Aristomachus, and Eriphyle, whom Amphiaraus married. Parthenopaeus had a son Promachus, who marched with the Epigoni against Thebes; and Mecisteus had a son Euryalus, who went to Troy. Pronax had a son Lycurgus; and Adrastus had by Amphithea, daughter of Pronax, three daughters, Argia, Deipyle, and Aegialia, and two sons, Aegialeus and Cyanippus.

[14] Φέρης δὲ ὁ Κρηθέως Φερὰς ἐν Θεσσαλίᾳ κτίσας ἐγέννησεν Ἄδμητον καὶ Λυκοῦργον. Λυκοῦργος μὲν οὖν περὶ Νεμέαν κατῴκησε, γήμας δὲ Εὐρυδίκην, ὡς δὲ ἔνιοί φασιν Ἀμφιθέαν, ἐγέννησεν Ὀφέλτην τὸν ὕστερον κληθέντα Ἀρχέμορον.

[14] Pheres, son of Cretheus, founded Pherae in Thessaly and begat Admetus and Lycurgus. Lycurgus took up his abode at Nemea, and having married Eurydice, or, as some say, Amphithea, he begat Opheltes, afterwards called Archemorus.

[15] Ἀδμήτου δὲ βασιλεύοντος τῶν Φερῶν, ἐθήτευσεν Ἀπόλλων αὐτῷ μνηστευομένῳ τὴν Πελίου θυγατέρα Ἄλκηστιν. ἐκείνου δὲ δώσειν ἐπαγγειλαμένου τὴν θυγατέρα τῷ καταζεύξαντι ἅρμα λέοντος καὶ κάπρου, Ἀπόλλων ζεύξας ἔδωκεν: ὁ δὲ κομίσας πρὸς Πελίαν Ἄλκηστιν λαμβάνει. θύων δὲ ἐν τοῖς γάμοις ἐξελάθετο Ἀρτέμιδι θῦσαι: διὰ τοῦτο τὸν θάλαμον ἀνοίξας εὗρε δρακόντων σπειράμασι πεπληρωμένον. Ἀπόλλων δὲ εἰπὼν ἐξιλάσκεσθαι τὴν θεόν, ᾐτήσατο παρὰ μοιρῶν ἵνα, ὅταν Ἄδμητος μέλλῃ τελευτᾶν, ἀπολυθῇ τοῦ θανάτου, ἂν ἑκουσίως τις ὑπὲρ αὐτοῦ θνήσκειν ἕληται. ὡς δὲ ἦλθεν ἡ τοῦ θνήσκειν ἡμέρα, μήτε τοῦ πατρὸς μήτε τῆς μητρὸς ὑπὲρ αὐτοῦ θνήσκειν θελόντων, Ἄλκηστις ὑπεραπέθανε. καὶ αὐτὴν πάλιν ἀνέπεμψεν ἡ Κόρη, ὡς δὲ ἔνιοι λέγουσιν, Ἡρακλῆς πρὸς αὐτὸν ἀνεκόμισε μαχεσάμενος Ἅιδῃ.

[15] When Admetus reigned over Pherae, Apollo served him as his thrall, while Admetus wooed Alcestis, daughter of Pelias. Now Pelias had promised to give his daughter to him who should yoke a lion and a boar to a car, and Apollo yoked and gave them to Admetus, who brought them to Pelias and so obtained Alcestis. But in offering a sacrifice at his marriage, he forgot to sacrifice to Artemis; therefore when he opened the marriage chamber he found it full of coiled snakes. Apollo bade him appease the goddess and obtained as a favour of the Fates that, when Admetus should be about to die, he might be released from death if someone should choose voluntarily to die for him. And when the day of his death came neither his father nor his mother would die for him, but Alcestis died in his stead. But the Maiden sent her up again, or, as some say, Hercules fought with Hades and brought her up to him.

[16] Αἴσονος δὲ τοῦ Κρηθέως καὶ Πολυμήδης τῆς Αὐτολύκου Ἰάσων. οὗτος ᾤκει ἐν Ἰωλκῷ, τῆς δὲ Ἰωλκοῦ Πελίας ἐβασίλευσε μετὰ Κρηθέα, ᾧ χρωμένῳ περὶ τῆς βασιλείας ἐθέσπισεν ὁ θεὸς τὸν μονοσάνδαλον φυλάξασθαι. τὸ μὲν οὖν πρῶτον ἠγνόει τὸν χρησμόν, αὖθις δὲ ὕστερον αὐτὸν ἔγνω. τελῶν γὰρ ἐπὶ τῇ θαλάσσῃ Ποσειδῶνι θυσίαν ἄλλους τε πολλοὺς ἐπὶ ταύτῃ καὶ τὸν Ἰάσονα μετεπέμψατο. ὁ δὲ πόθῳ γεωργίας ἐν τοῖς χωρίοις διατελῶν ἔσπευσεν ἐπὶ τὴν θυσίαν: διαβαίνων δὲ ποταμὸν Ἄναυρον ἐξῆλθε μονοσάνδαλος, τὸ ἕτερον ἀπολέσας ἐν τῷ ῥείθρῳ πέδιλον. θεασάμενος δὲ Πελίας αὐτὸν καὶ τὸν χρησμὸν συμβαλὼν ἠρώτα προσελθών, τί ἂν ἐποίησεν ἐξουσίαν ἔχων, εἰ λόγιον ἦν αὐτῷ πρός τινος φονευθήσεσθαι τῶν πολιτῶν. ὁ δέ, εἴτε ἐπελθὸν ἄλλως, εἴτε διὰ μῆνιν Ἥρας, ἵν᾽ ἔλθοι κακὸν Μήδεια Πελίᾳ （τὴν γὰρ Ἥραν οὐκ ἐτίμα）, ‘τὸ χρυσόμαλλον δέρας’ ἔφη ‘προσέταττον ἂν φέρειν αὐτῷ.’ τοῦτο Πελίας ἀκούσας εὐθὺς ἐπὶ τὸ δέρας ἐλθεῖν ἐκέλευσεν αὐτόν. τοῦτο δὲ ἐν Κόλχοις ἦν ἐν Ἄρεος ἄλσει κρεμάμενον ἐκ δρυός, ἐφρουρεῖτο δὲ ὑπὸ δράκοντος ἀύπνου.ἐπὶ τοῦτο πεμπόμενος Ἰάσων Ἄργον παρεκάλεσε τὸν Φρίξου, κἀκεῖνος Ἀθηνᾶς ὑποθεμένης πεντηκόντορον ναῦν κατεσκεύασε τὴν προσαγορευθεῖσαν ἀπὸ τοῦ κατασκευάσαντος Ἀργώ: κατὰ δὲ τὴν πρῷραν ἐνήρμοσεν Ἀθηνᾶ φωνῆεν φηγοῦ τῆς Δωδωνίδος ξύλον. ὡς δὲ ἡ ναῦς κατεσκευάσθη, χρωμένῳ ὁ θεὸς αὐτῷ πλεῖν ἐπέτρεψε συναθροίσαντι τοὺς ἀρίστους τῆς Ἑλλάδος. οἱ δὲ συναθροισθέντες εἰσὶν οἵδε: Τῖφυς Ἁγνίου, ὃς ἐκυβέρνα τὴν ναῦν, Ὀρφεὺς Οἰάγρου, Ζήτης καὶ Κάλαϊς Βορέου, Κάστωρ καὶ Πολυδεύκης Διός, Τελαμὼν καὶ Πηλεὺς Αἰακοῦ, Ἡρακλῆς Διός, Θησεὺς Αἰγέως, Ἴδας καὶ Λυγκεὺς Ἀφαρέως, Ἀμφιάραος Ὀικλέους, Καινεὺς Κορώνου Παλαίμων Ἡφαίστου ἢ Αἰτωλοῦ, Κηφεὺς Ἀλεοῦ, Λαέρτης Ἀρκεισίου, Αὐτόλυκος Ἑρμοῦ, Ἀταλάντη Σχοινέως, Μενοίτιος Ἄκτορος, Ἄκτωρ Ἱππάσου, Ἄδμητος Φέρητος, Ἄκαστος Πελίου, Εὔρυτος Ἑρμοῦ, Μελέαγρος Οἰνέως, Ἀγκαῖος Λυκούργου, Εὔφημος Ποσειδῶνος, Ποίας Θαυμάκου, Βούτης Τελέοντος, Φᾶνος καὶ Στάφυλος Διονύσου, Ἐργῖνος Ποσειδῶνος, Περικλύμενος Νηλέως, Αὐγέας Ἡλίου, Ἴφικλος Θεστίου, Ἄργος Φρίξου, Εὐρύαλος Μηκιστέως, Πηνέλεως Ἱππάλμου, Λήιτος Ἀλέκτορος, Ἴφιτος Ναυβόλου, Ἀσκάλαφος καὶ Ἰάλμενος Ἄρεος, Ἀστέριος Κομήτου, Πολύφημος Ἐλάτου.

[16] Aeson, son of Cretheus, had a son Jason by Polymede, daughter of Autolycus. Now Jason dwelt in Iolcus, of which Pelias was king after Cretheus. But when Pelias consulted the oracle concerning the kingdom, the god warned him to beware of the man with a single sandal. At first the king understood not the oracle, but afterwards he apprehended it. For when he was offering a sacrifice at the sea to Poseidon, he sent for Jason, among many others, to participate in it. Now Jason loved husbandry and therefore abode in the country, but he hastened to the sacrifice, and in crossing the river Anaurus he lost a sandal in the stream and landed with only one. When Pelias saw him, he bethought him of the oracle, and going up to Jason asked him what, supposing he had the power, he would do if he had received an oracle that he should be murdered by one of the citizens. Jason answered, whether at haphazard or instigated by the angry Hera in order that Medea should prove a curse to Pelias, who did not honor Hera, “ I would command him,” said he, “ to bring the Golden Fleece. “ No sooner did Pelias hear that than he bade him go in quest of the fleece. Now it was at Colchis in a grove of Ares, hanging on an oak and guarded by a sleepless dragon.Sent to fetch the fleece, Jason called in the help of Argus, son of Phrixus; and Argus, by Athena’s advice, built a ship of fifty oars named Argo after its builder; and at the prow Athena fitted in a speaking timber from the oak of Dodona. When the ship was built, and he inquired of the oracle, the god gave him leave to assemble the nobles of Greece and sail away. And those who assembled were as follows: Tiphys, son of Hagnias, who steered the ship; Orpheus, son of Oeagrus; Zetes and Calais, sons of Boreas; Castor and Pollux, sons of Zeus; Telamon and Peleus, sons of Aeacus; Hercules, son of Zeus; Theseus, son of Aegeus; Idas and Lynceus, sons of Aphareus; Amphiaraus, son of Oicles; Caeneus, son of Coronus; Palaemon, son of Hephaestus or of Aetolus; Cepheus, son of Aleus; Laertes son of Arcisius; Autolycus, son of Hermes; Atalanta, daughter of Schoeneus; Menoetius, son of Actor; Actor, son of Hippasus; Admetus, son of Pheres; Acastus, son of Pelias; Eurytus, son of Hermes; Meleager, son of Oeneus; Ancaeus, son of Lycurgus; Euphemus, son of Poseidon; Poeas, son of Thaumacus; Butes, son of Teleon; Phanus and Staphylus, sons of Dionysus; Erginus, son of Poseidon; Periclymenus, son of Neleus; Augeas, son of the Sun; Iphiclus, son of Thestius; Argus, son of Phrixus; Euryalus, son of Mecisteus; Peneleos, son of Hippalmus; Leitus, son of Alector; Iphitus, son of Naubolus; Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of Ares; Asterius, son of Cometes; Polyphemus, son of Elatus.

[17] οὗτοι ναυαρχοῦντος Ἰάσονος ἀναχθέντες προσίσχουσι Λήμνῳ. ἔτυχε δὲ ἡ Λῆμνος ἀνδρῶν τότε οὖσα ἔρημος, βασιλευομένη δὲ ὑπὸ Ὑψιπύλης τῆς Θόαντος δι᾽ αἰτίαν τήνδε. αἱ Λήμνιαι τὴν Ἀφροδίτην οὐκ ἐτίμων: ἡ δὲ αὐταῖς ἐμβάλλει δυσοσμίαν, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο οἱ γήμαντες αὐτὰς ἐκ τῆς πλησίον Θρᾴκης λαβόντες αἰχμαλωτίδας συνευνάζοντο αὐταῖς. ἀτιμαζόμεναι δὲ αἱ Λήμνιαι τούς τε πατέρας καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας φονεύουσι: μόνη δὲ ἔσωσεν Ὑψιπύλη τὸν ἑαυτῆς πατέρα κρύψασα Θόαντα. προσσχόντες οὖν τότε γυναικοκρατουμένῃ τῇ Λήμνῳ μίσγονται ταῖς γυναιξίν. Ὑψιπύλη δὲ Ἰάσονι συνευνάζεται, καὶ γεννᾷ παῖδας Εὔνηον καὶ Νεβροφόνον.

[17] These with Jason as admiral put to sea and touched at Lemnos. At that time it chanced that Lemnos was bereft of men and ruled over by a queen, Hypsipyle, daughter of Thoas, the reason of which was as follows. The Lemnian women did not honor Aphrodite, and she visited them with a noisome smell; therefore their spouses took captive women from the neighboring country of Thrace and bedded with them. Thus dishonored, the Lemnian women murdered their fathers and husbands, but Hypsipyle alone saved her father Thoas by hiding him. So having put in to Lemnos, at that time ruled by women, the Argonauts had intercourse with the women, and Hypsipyle bedded with Jason and bore sons, Euneus and Nebrophonus.

[18] ἀπὸ Λήμνου δὲ προσίσχουσι Δολίοσιν, ὧν ἐβασίλευε Κύζικος. οὗτος αὐτοὺς ὑπεδέξατο φιλοφρόνως. νυκτὸς δὲ ἀναχθέντες ἐντεῦθεν καὶ περιπεσόντες ἀντιπνοίαις, ἀγνοοῦντες πάλιν τοῖς Δολίοσι προσίσχουσιν. οἱ δὲ νομίζοντες Πελασγικὸν εἶναι στρατόν （ἔτυχον γὰρ ὑπὸ Πελασγῶν συνεχῶς πολεμούμενοι） μάχην τῆς νυκτὸς συνάπτουσιν ἀγνοοῦντες πρὸς ἀγνοοῦντας. κτείναντες δὲ πολλοὺς οἱ Ἀργοναῦται, μεθ᾽ ὧν καὶ Κύζικον, μεθ᾽ ἡμέραν, ὡς ἔγνωσαν, ἀποδυράμενοι τάς τε κόμας ἐκείραντο καὶ τὸν Κύζικον πολυτελῶς ἔθαψαν. καὶ μετὰ τὴν ταφὴν πλεύσαντες Μυσίᾳ προσίσχουσιν.

[18] And after Lemnos they landed among the Doliones, of whom Cyzicus was king. He received them kindly. But having put to sea from there by night and met with contrary winds, they lost their bearings and landed again among the Doliones. However, the Doliones, taking them for a Pelasgian army （ for they were constantly harassed by the Pelasgians）, joined battle with them by night in mutual ignorance of each other. The Argonauts slew many and among the rest Cyzicus; but by day, when they knew what they had done, they mourned and cut off their hair and gave Cyzicus a costly burial; and after the burial they sailed away and touched at Mysia.

[19] ἐνταῦθα δὲ Ἡρακλέα καὶ Πολύφημον κατέλιπον. Ὕλας γὰρ ὁ Θειοδάμαντος παῖς, Ἡρακλέους δὲ ἐρώμενος, ἀποσταλεὶς ὑδρεύσασθαι διὰ κάλλος ὑπὸ νυμφῶν ἡρπάγη. Πολύφημος δὲ ἀκούσας αὐτοῦ βοήσαντος, σπασάμενος τὸ ξίφος ἐδίωκεν, ὑπὸ λῃστῶν ἄγεσθαι νομίζων. καὶ δηλοῖ συντυχόντι Ἡρακλεῖ. ζητούντων δὲ ἀμφοτέρων τὸν Ὕλαν ἡ ναῦς ἀνήχθη, καὶ Πολύφημος μὲν ἐν Μυσίᾳ κτίσας πόλιν Κίον ἐβασίλευσεν, Ἡρακλῆς δὲ ὑπέστρεψεν εἰς Ἄργος. Ἡρόδωρος δὲ αὐτὸν οὐδὲ τὴν ἀρχήν φησι πλεῦσαι τότε, ἀλλὰ παρ᾽ Ὀμφάλῃ δουλεύειν. Φερεκύδης δὲ αὐτὸν ἐν Ἀφεταῖς τῆς Θεσσαλίας ἀπολειφθῆναι λέγει, τῆς Ἀργοῦς φθεγξαμένης μὴ δύνασθαι φέρειν τὸ τούτου βάρος. Δημάρατος δὲ αὐτὸν εἰς Κόλχους πεπλευκότα παρέδωκε: Διονύσιος μὲν γὰρ αὐτὸν καὶ ἡγεμόνα φησὶ τῶν Ἀργοναυτῶν γενέσθαι.

[19] There they left Hercules and Polyphemus. For Hylas, son of Thiodamas, a minion of Hercules, had been sent to draw water and was ravished away by nymphs on account of his beauty. But Polyphemus heard him cry out, and drawing his sword gave chase in the belief that he was being carried off by robbers. Falling in with Hercules, he told him; and while the two were seeking for Hylas, the ship put to sea. So Polyphemus founded a city Cius in Mysia and reigned as king; but Hercules returned to Argos. However Herodorus says that Hercules did not sail at all at that time, but served as a slave at the court of Omphale. But Pherecydes says that he was left behind at Aphetae in Thessaly, the Argo having declared with human voice that she could not bear his weight. Nevertheless Demaratus has recorded that Hercules sailed to Colchis; for Dionysius even affirms that he was the leader of the Argonauts.

[20] ἀπὸ δὲ Μυσίας ἀπῆλθον εἰς τὴν Βεβρύκων γῆν, ἧς ἐβασίλευεν Ἄμυκος Ποσειδῶνος παῖς καὶ νύμφης Βιθυνίδος. γενναῖος δὲ ὢν οὗτος τοὺς προσσχόντας ξένους ἠνάγκαζε πυκτεύειν καὶ τοῦτον τὸν τρόπον ἀνῄρει. παραγενόμενος οὖν καὶ τότε ἐπὶ τὴν Ἀργὼ τὸν ἄριστον αὐτῶν εἰς πυγμὴν προεκαλεῖτο. Πολυδεύκης δὲ ὑποσχόμενος πυκτεύσειν πρὸς αὐτόν, πλήξας κατὰ τὸν ἀγκῶνα ἀπέκτεινε. τῶν δὲ Βεβρύκων ὁρμησάντων πρὸς αὐτόν, ἁρπάσαντες οἱ ἀριστεῖς τὰ ὅπλα πολλοὺς φεύγοντας φονεύουσιν αὐτῶν.

[20] From Mysia they departed to the land of the Bebryces, which was ruled by King Amycus, son of Poseidon and a Bithynian nymph. Being a doughty man he compelled the strangers that landed to box and in that way made an end of them. So going to the Argo as usual, he challenged the best man of the crew to a boxing match. Pollux undertook to box against him and killed him with a blow on the elbow. When the Bebryces made a rush at him, the chiefs snatched up their arms and put them to flight with great slaughter.

[21] ἐντεῦθεν ἀναχθέντες καταντῶσιν εἰς τὴν τῆς Θρᾴκης Σαλμυδησσόν, ἔνθα ᾤκει Φινεὺς μάντις τὰς ὄψεις πεπηρωμένος. τοῦτον οἱ μὲν Ἀγήνορος εἶναι λέγουσιν, οἱ δὲ Ποσειδῶνος υἱόν: καὶ πηρωθῆναί φασιν αὐτὸν οἱ μὲν ὑπὸ θεῶν, ὅτι προέλεγε τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τὰ μέλλοντα, οἱ δὲ ὑπὸ Βορέου καὶ τῶν Ἀργοναυτῶν, ὅτι πεισθεὶς μητρυιᾷ τοὺς ἰδίους ἐτύφλωσε παῖδας, τινὲς δὲ ὑπὸ Ποσειδῶνος, ὅτι τοῖς Φρίξου παισὶ τὸν ἐκ Κόλχων εἰς τὴν Ἑλλάδα πλοῦν ἐμήνυσεν. ἔπεμψαν δὲ αὐτῷ καὶ τὰς ἁρπυίας οἱ θεοί: πτερωταὶ δὲ ἦσαν αὗται, καὶ ἐπειδὴ τῷ Φινεῖ παρετίθετο τράπεζα, ἐξ οὐρανοῦ καθιπτάμεναι τὰ μὲν πλείονα ἀνήρπαζον, ὀλίγα δὲ ὅσα ὀσμῆς ἀνάπλεα κατέλειπον, ὥστε μὴ δύνασθαι προσενέγκασθαι. βουλομένοις δὲ τοῖς Ἀργοναύταις τὰ περὶ τοῦ πλοῦ μαθεῖν ὑποθήσεσθαι τὸν πλοῦν ἔφη, τῶν ἁρπυιῶν αὐτὸν ἐὰν ἀπαλλάξωσιν. οἱ δὲ παρέθεσαν αὐτῷ τράπεζαν ἐδεσμάτων, ἅρπυιαι δὲ ἐξαίφνης σὺν βοῇ καταπτᾶσαι τὴν τροφὴν ἥρπασαν. θεασάμενοι δὲ οἱ Βορέου παῖδες Ζήτης καὶ Κάλαϊς, ὄντες πτερωτοί, σπασάμενοι τὰ ξίφη δι᾽ ἀέρος ἐδίωκον. ἦν δὲ ταῖς ἁρπυίαις χρεὼν τεθνάναι ὑπὸ τῶν Βορέου παίδων, τοῖς δὲ Βορέου παισὶ τότε τελευτήσειν ὅταν διώκοντες μὴ καταλάβωσι. διωκομένων δὲ τῶν ἁρπυιῶν ἡ μὲν κατὰ Πελοπόννησον εἰς τὸν Τίγρην ποταμὸν ἐμπίπτει, ὃς νῦν ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνης Ἅρπυς καλεῖται: ταύτην δὲ οἱ μὲν Νικοθόην οἱ δὲ Ἀελλόπουν καλοῦσιν. ἡ δὲ ἑτέρα καλουμένη Ὠκυπέτη, ὡς δὲ ἔνιοι Ὠκυθόη （Ἡσίοδος δὲ λέγει αὐτὴν Ὠκυπόδην）, αὕτη κατὰ τὴν Προποντίδα φεύγουσα μέχρις Ἐχινάδων ἦλθε νήσων, αἳ νῦν ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνης Στροφάδες καλοῦνται: ἐστράφη γὰρ ὡς ἦλθεν ἐπὶ ταύτας, καὶ γενομένη κατὰ τὴν ἠιόνα ὑπὸ καμάτου πίπτει σὺν τῷ διώκοντι. Ἀπολλώνιος δὲ ἐν τοῖς Ἀργοναύταις ἕως Στροφάδων νήσων φησὶν αὐτὰς διωχθῆναι καὶ μηδὲν παθεῖν, δούσας ὅρκον τὸν Φινέα μηκέτι ἀδικῆσαι.

[21] Thence they put to sea and came to land at Salmydessus in Thrace, where dwelt Phineus, a seer who had lost the sight of both eyes. Some say he was a son of Agenor, but others that he was a son of Poseidon, and he is variously alleged to have been blinded by the gods for foretelling men the future; or by Boreas and the Argonauts because he blinded his own sons at the instigation of their stepmother; or by Poseidon, because he revealed to the children of Phrixus how they could sail from Colchis to Greece. The gods also sent the Harpies to him. These were winged female creatures, and when a table was laid for Phineus, they flew down from the sky and snatched up most of the victuals, and what little they left stank so that nobody could touch it. When the Argonauts would have consulted him about the voyage, he said that he would advise them about it if they would rid him of the Harpies. So the Argonauts laid a table of viands beside him, and the Harpies with a shriek suddenly pounced down and snatched away the food. When Zetes and Calais, the sons of Boreas, saw that, they drew their swords and, being winged, pursued them through the air. Now it was fated that the Harpies should perish by the sons of Boreas, and that the sons of Boreas should die when they could not catch up a fugitive. So the Harpies were pursued and one of them fell into the river Tigres in Peloponnese, the river that is now called Harpys after her; some call her Nicothoe, but others Aellopus. But the other, named Ocypete or, according to others, Ocythoe （ but Hesiod calls her Ocypode） fled by the Propontis till she came to the Echinadian Islands, which are now called Strophades after her; for when she came to them she turned （estraphe） and being at the shore fell for very weariness with her pursuer. But Apollonius in the Argonautica says that the Harpies were pursued to the Strophades Islands and suffered no harm, having sworn an oath that they would wrong Phineus no more.

[22] ἀπαλλαγεὶς δὲ τῶν ἁρπυιῶν Φινεὺς ἐμήνυσε τὸν πλοῦν τοῖς Ἀργοναύταις, καὶ περὶ τῶν συμπληγάδων ὑπέθετο πετρῶν τῶν κατὰ θάλασσαν. ἦσαν δὲ ὑπερμεγέθεις αὗται, συγκρουόμεναι δὲ ἀλλήλαις ὑπὸ τῆς τῶν πνευμάτων βίας τὸν διὰ θαλάσσης πόρον ἀπέκλειον. ἐφέρετο δὲ πολλὴ μὲν ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν ὁμίχλη πολὺς δὲ πάταγος, ἦν δὲ ἀδύνατον καὶ τοῖς πετεινοῖς δι᾽ αὐτῶν διελθεῖν. εἶπεν οὖν αὐτοῖς ἀφεῖναι πελειάδα διὰ τῶν πετρῶν, καὶ ταύτην ἐὰν μὲν ἴδωσι σωθεῖσαν, διαπλεῖν καταφρονοῦντας, ἐὰν δὲ ἀπολομένην, μὴ πλεῖν βιάζεσθαι. ταῦτα ἀκούσαντες ἀνήγοντο, καὶ ὡς πλησίον ἦσαν τῶν πετρῶν, ἀφιᾶσιν ἐκ τῆς πρῴρας πελειάδα: τῆς δὲ ἱπταμένης τὰ ἄκρα τῆς οὐρᾶς ἡ σύμπτωσις τῶν πετρῶν ἀπεθέρισεν. ἀναχωρούσας οὖν ἐπιτηρήσαντες τὰς πέτρας μετ᾽ εἰρεσίας ἐντόνου, συλλαβομένης Ἥρας, διῆλθον, τὰ ἄκρα τῶν ἀφλάστων τῆς νεὼς περικοπείσης. αἱ μὲν οὖν συμπληγάδες ἔκτοτε ἔστησαν: χρεὼν γὰρ ἦν αὐταῖς νεὼς περαιωθείσης στῆναι παντελῶς.

[22] Being rid of the Harpies, Phineus revealed to the Argonauts the course of their voyage, and advised them about the Clashing Rocks in the sea. These were huge cliffs, which, dashed together by the force of the winds, closed the sea passage. Thick was the mist that swept over them, and loud the crash, and it was impossible for even the birds to pass between them. So he told them to let fly a dove between the rocks, and, if they saw it pass safe through, to thread the narrows with an easy mind, but if they saw it perish, then not to force a passage. When they heard that, they put to sea, and on nearing the rocks let fly a dove from the prow, and as she flew the clash of the rocks nipped off the tip of her tail. So, waiting till the rocks had recoiled, with hard rowing and the help of Hera, they passed through, the extremity of the ship’s ornamented poop being shorn away right round. Henceforth the Clashing Rocks stood still; for it was fated that, so soon as a ship had made the passage, they should come to rest completely.

[23] οἱ δὲ Ἀργοναῦται πρὸς Μαριανδυνοὺς παρεγένοντο, κἀκεῖ φιλοφρόνως ὁ βασιλεὺς ὑπεδέξατο Λύκος. ἔνθα θνήσκει μὲν Ἴδμων ὁ μάντις πλήξαντος αὐτὸν κάπρου, θνήσκει δὲ καὶ Τῖφυς, καὶ τὴν ναῦν Ἀγκαῖος ὑπισχνεῖται κυβερνᾶν.παραπλεύσαντες δὲ Θερμώδοντα καὶ Καύκασον ἐπὶ Φᾶσιν ποταμὸν ἦλθον: οὗτος τῆς Κολχικῆς ἐστιν. ἐγκαθορμισθείσης δὲ τῆς νεὼς ἧκε πρὸς Αἰήτην Ἰάσων, καὶ τὰ ἐπιταγέντα ὑπὸ Πελίου λέγων παρεκάλει δοῦναι τὸ δέρας αὐτῷ: ὁ δὲ δώσειν ὑπέσχετο, ἐὰν τοὺς χαλκόποδας ταύρους μόνος καταζεύξῃ. ἦσαν δὲ ἄγριοι παρ᾽ αὐτῷ ταῦροι δύο, μεγέθει διαφέροντες, δῶρον Ἡφαίστου, οἳ χαλκοῦς μὲν εἶχον πόδας, πῦρ δὲ ἐκ στομάτων ἐφύσων. τούτους αὐτῷ ζεύξαντι ἐπέτασσε σπείρειν δράκοντος ὀδόντας: εἶχε γὰρ λαβὼν παρ᾽ Ἀθηνᾶς τοὺς ἡμίσεις ὧν Κάδμος ἔσπειρεν ἐν Θήβαις. ἀποροῦντος δὲ τοῦ Ἰάσονος πῶς ἂν δύναιτο τοὺς ταύρους καταζεῦξαι, Μήδεια αὐτοῦ ἔρωτα ἴσχει: ἦν δὲ αὕτη θυγάτηρ Αἰήτου καὶ Εἰδυίας τῆς Ὠκεανοῦ, φαρμακίς. δεδοικυῖα δὲ μὴ πρὸς τῶν ταύρων διαφθαρῇ, κρύφα τοῦ πατρὸς συνεργήσειν αὐτῷ πρὸς τὴν κατάζευξιν τῶν ταύρων ἐπηγγείλατο καὶ τὸ δέρας ἐγχειριεῖν, ἐὰν ὀμόσῃ αὐτὴν ἕξειν γυναῖκα καὶ εἰς Ἑλλάδα σύμπλουν ἀγάγηται. ὀμόσαντος δὲ Ἰάσονος φάρμακον δίδωσιν, ᾧ καταζευγνύναι μέλλοντα τοὺς ταύρους ἐκέλευσε χρῖσαι τήν τε ἀσπίδα καὶ τὸ δόρυ καὶ τὸ σῶμα: τούτῳ γὰρ χρισθέντα ἔφη πρὸς μίαν ἡμέραν μήτ᾽ ἂν ὑπὸ πυρὸς ἀδικηθήσεσθαι μήτε ὑπὸ σιδήρου. ἐδήλωσε δὲ αὐτῷ σπειρομένων τῶν ὀδόντων ἐκ γῆς ἄνδρας μέλλειν ἀναδύεσθαι ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν καθωπλισμένους, οὓς ἔλεγεν ἐπειδὰν ἀθρόους θεάσηται, βάλλειν εἰς μέσον λίθους ἄποθεν, ὅταν δὲ ὑπὲρ τούτου μάχωνται πρὸς ἀλλήλους, τότε κτείνειν αὐτούς. Ἰάσων δὲ τοῦτο ἀκούσας καὶ χρισάμενος τῷ φαρμάκῳ, παραγενόμενος εἰς τὸ τοῦ νεὼ ἄλσος ἐμάστευε τοὺς ταύρους, καὶ σὺν πολλῷ πυρὶ ὁρμήσαντας αὐτοὺς κατέζευξε. σπείραντος δὲ αὐτοῦ τοὺς ὀδόντας ἀνέτελλον ἐκ τῆς γῆς ἄνδρες ἔνοπλοι: ὁ δὲ ὅπου πλείονας ἑώρα, βάλλων ἀφανῶς λίθους, πρὸς αὐτοὺς μαχομένους πρὸς ἀλλήλους προσιὼν ἀνῄρει. καὶ κατεζευγμένων τῶν ταύρων οὐκ ἐδίδου τὸ δέρας Αἰήτης, ἐβούλετο δὲ τήν τε Ἀργὼ καταφλέξαι καὶ κτεῖναι τοὺς ἐμπλέοντας. φθάσασα δὲ Μήδεια τὸν Ἰάσονα νυκτὸς ἐπὶ τὸ δέρας ἤγαγε, καὶ τὸν φυλάσσοντα δράκοντα κατακοιμίσασα τοῖς φαρμάκοις μετὰ Ἰάσονος, ἔχουσα τὸ δέρας, ἐπὶ τὴν Ἀργὼ παρεγένετο. συνείπετο δὲ αὐτῇ καὶ ὁ ἀδελφὸς Ἄψυρτος. οἱ δὲ νυκτὸς μετὰ τούτων ἀνήχθησαν.

[23] The Argonauts now arrived among the Mariandynians, and there King Lycus received them kindly. There died Idmon the seer of a wound inflicted by a boar; and there too died Tiphys, and Ancaeus undertook to steer the ship.And having sailed past the Thermodon and the Caucasus they came to the river Phasis, which is in the Colchian land. When the ship was brought into port, Jason repaired to Aeetes, and setting forth the charge laid on him by Pelias invited him to give him the fleece. The other promised to give it if single-handed he would yoke the brazen-footed bulls. These were two wild bulls that he had, of enormous size, a gift of Hephaestus; they had brazen feet and puffed fire from their mouths. These creatures Aeetes ordered him to yoke and to sow dragon’s teeth; for he had got from Athena half of the dragon’s teeth which Cadmus sowed in Thebes. While Jason puzzled how he could yoke the bulls, Medea conceived a passion for him; now she was a witch, daughter of Aeetes and Idyia, daughter of Ocean. And fearing lest he might be destroyed by the bulls, she, keeping the thing from her father, promised to help him to yoke the bulls and to deliver to him the fleece, if he would swear to have her to wife and would take her with him on the voyage to Greece. When Jason swore to do so, she gave him a drug with which she bade him anoint his shield, spear, and body when he was about to yoke the bulls; for she said that, anointed with it, he could for a single day be harmed neither by fire nor by iron. And she signified to him that, when the teeth were sown, armed men would spring up from the ground against him; and when he saw a knot of them he was to throw stones into their midst from a distance, and when they fought each other about that, he was taken to kill them. On hearing that, Jason anointed himself with the drug, and being come to the grove of the temple he sought the bulls, and though they charged him with a flame of fire, he yoked them. And when he had sowed the teeth, there rose armed men from the ground; and where he saw several together, he pelted them unseen with stones, and when they fought each other he drew near and slew them. But though the bulls were yoked, Aeetes did not give the fleece; for he wished to burn down the Argo and kill the crew. But before he could do so, Medea brought Jason by night to the fleece, and having lulled to sleep by her drugs the dragon that guarded it, she possessed herself of the fleece and in Jason’s company came to the Argo. She was attended, too, by her brother Apsyrtus. And with them the Argonauts put to sea by night.

[24] Αἰήτης δὲ ἐπιγνοὺς τὰ τῇ Μηδείᾳ τετολμημένα ὥρμησε τὴν ναῦν διώκειν. ἰδοῦσα δὲ αὐτὸν πλησίον ὄντα Μήδεια τὸν ἀδελφὸν φονεύει καὶ μελίσασα κατὰ τοῦ βυθοῦ ῥίπτει. συναθροίζων δὲ Αἰήτης τὰ τοῦ παιδὸς μέλη τῆς διώξεως ὑστέρησε: διόπερ ὑποστρέψας, καὶ τὰ σωθέντα τοῦ παιδὸς μέλη θάψας, τὸν τόπον προσηγόρευσε Τόμους. πολλοὺς δὲ τῶν Κόλχων ἐπὶ τὴν ζήτησιν τῆς Ἀργοῦς ἐξέπεμψεν, ἀπειλήσας, εἰ μὴ Μήδειαν ἄξουσιν, αὐτοὺς πείσεσθαι τὰ ἐκείνης. οἱ δὲ σχισθέντες ἄλλος ἀλλαχοῦ ζήτησιν ἐποιοῦντο.τοῖς δὲ Ἀργοναύταις τὸν Ἠριδανὸν ποταμὸν ἤδη παραπλέουσι Ζεὺς μηνίσας ὑπὲρ τοῦ φονευθέντος Ἀψύρτου χειμῶνα λάβρον ἐπιπέμψας ἐμβάλλει πλάνην. καὶ αὐτῶν τὰς Ἀψυρτίδας νήσους παραπλεόντων ἡ ναῦς φθέγγεται μὴ λήξειν τὴν ὀργὴν τοῦ Διός, ἐὰν μὴ πορευθέντες εἰς τὴν Αὐσονίαν τὸν Ἀψύρτου φόνον καθαρθῶσιν ὑπὸ Κίρκης. οἱ δὲ παραπλεύσαντες τὰ Λιγύων καὶ Κελτῶν ἔθνη, καὶ διὰ τοῦ Σαρδονίου πελάγους διακομισθέντες, παραμειψάμενοι Τυρρηνίαν ἦλθον εἰς Αἰαίην, ἔνθα Κίρκης ἱκέται γενόμενοι καθαίρονται.

[24] When Aeetes discovered the daring deeds done by Medea, he started off in pursuit of the ship; but when she saw him near, Medea murdered her brother and cutting him limb from limb threw the pieces into the deep. Gathering the child’s limbs, Aeetes fell behind in the pursuit; wherefore he turned back, and, having buried the rescued limbs of his child, he called the place Tomi. But he sent out many of the Colchians to search for the Argo, threatening that, if they did not bring Medea to him, they should suffer the punishment due to her; so they separated and pursued the search in divers places.When the Argonauts were already sailing past the Eridanus river, Zeus sent a furious storm upon them, and drove them out of their course, because he was angry at the murder of Apsyrtus. And as they were sailing past the Apsyrtides Islands, the ship spoke, saying that the wrath of Zeus would not cease unless they journeyed to Ausonia and were purified by Circe for the murder of Apsyrtus. So when they had sailed past the Ligurian and Celtic nations and had voyaged through the Sardinian Sea, they skirted Tyrrhenia and came to Aeaea, where they supplicated Circe and were purified.

[25] παραπλεόντων δὲ Σειρῆνας αὐτῶν, Ὀρφεὺς τὴν ἐναντίαν μοῦσαν μελῳδῶν τοὺς Ἀργοναύτας κατέσχε. μόνος δὲ Βούτης ἐξενήξατο πρὸς αὐτάς, ὃν ἁρπάσασα Ἀφροδίτη ἐν Λιλυβαίῳ κατῴκισε.μετὰ δὲ τὰς Σειρῆνας τὴν ναῦν Χάρυβδις ἐξεδέχετο καὶ Σκύλλα καὶ πέτραι πλαγκταί, ὑπὲρ ὧν φλὸξ πολλὴ καὶ καπνὸς ἀναφερόμενος ἑωρᾶτο. ἀλλὰ διὰ τούτων διεκόμισε τὴν ναῦν σὺν Νηρηίσι Θέτις παρακληθεῖσα ὑπὸ Ἥρας.παραμειψάμενοι δὲ Θρινακίαν νῆσον Ἡλίου βοῦς ἔχουσαν εἰς τὴν Φαιάκων νῆσον Κέρκυραν ἧκον, ἧς βασιλεὺς ἦν Ἀλκίνοος. τῶν δὲ Κόλχων τὴν ναῦν εὑρεῖν μὴ δυναμένων οἱ μὲν τοῖς Κεραυνίοις ὄρεσι παρῴκησαν, οἱ δὲ εἰς τὴν Ἰλλυρίδα κομισθέντες ἔκτισαν Ἀψυρτίδας νήσους: ἔνιοι δὲ πρὸς Φαίακας ἐλθόντες τὴν Ἀργὼ κατέλαβον καὶ τὴν Μήδειαν ἀπῄτουν παρ᾽ Ἀλκινόου. ὁ δὲ εἶπεν, εἰ μὲν ἤδη συνελήλυθεν Ἰάσονι, δώσειν αὐτὴν ἐκείνῳ, εἰ δ᾽ ἔτι παρθένος ἐστί, τῷ πατρὶ ἀποπέμψειν. Ἀρήτη δὲ ἡ Ἀλκινόου γυνὴ φθάσασα Μήδειαν Ἰάσονι συνέζευξεν: ὅθεν οἱ μὲν Κόλχοι μετὰ Φαιάκων κατῴκησαν, οἱ δὲ Ἀργοναῦται μετὰ τῆς Μηδείας ἀνήχθησαν.

[25] And as they sailed past the Sirens, Orpheus restrained the Argonauts by chanting a counter-melody. Butes alone swam off to the Sirens, but Aphrodite carried him away and settled him in Lilybaeum.After the Sirens, the ship encountered Charybdis and Scylla and the Wandering Rocks, above which a great flame and smoke were seen rising. But Thetis with the Nereids steered the ship through them at the summons of Hera.Having passed by the Island of Thrinacia, where are the kine of the Sun, they came to Corcyra, the island of the Phaeacians, of which Alcinous was king. But when the Colchians could not find the ship, some of them settled at the Ceraunian mountains, and some journeyed to Illyria and colonized the Apsyrtides Islands. But some came to the Phaeacians, and finding the Argo there, they demanded of Alcinous that he should give up Medea. He answered, that if she already knew Jason, he would give her to him, but that if she were still a maid he would send her away to her father. However, Arete, wife of Alcinous, anticipated matters by marrying Medea to Jason; hence the Colchians settled down among the Phaeacians and the Argonauts put to sea with Medea.

[26] πλέοντες δὲ νυκτὸς σφοδρῷ περιπίπτουσι χειμῶνι. Ἀπόλλων δὲ στὰς ἐπὶ τὰς Μελαντίους δειράς, τοξεύσας τῷ βέλει εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν κατήστραψεν. οἱ δὲ πλησίον ἐθεάσαντο νῆσον, τῷ δὲ παρὰ προσδοκίαν ἀναφανῆναι προσορμισθέντες Ἀνάφην ἐκάλεσαν: ἱδρυσάμενοι δὲ βωμὸν Ἀπόλλωνος αἰγλήτου καὶ θυσιάσαντες ἐπ᾽ εὐωχίαν ἐτράπησαν. δοθεῖσαι δ᾽ ὑπὸ Ἀρήτης Μηδείᾳ δώδεκα θεράπαιναι τοὺς ἀριστέας ἔσκωπτον μετὰ παιγνίας: ὅθεν ἔτι καὶ νῦν ἐν τῇ θυσίᾳ σύνηθές ἐστι σκώπτειν ταῖς γυναιξίν.ἐντεῦθεν ἀναχθέντες κωλύονται Κρήτῃ προσίσχειν ὑπὸ Τάλω. τοῦτον οἱ μὲν τοῦ χαλκοῦ γένους εἶναι λέγουσιν, οἱ δὲ ὑπὸ Ἡφαίστου Μίνωι δοθῆναι: ὃς ἦν χαλκοῦς ἀνήρ, οἱ δὲ ταῦρον αὐτὸν λέγουσιν. εἶχε δὲ φλέβα μίαν ἀπὸ αὐχένος κατατείνουσαν ἄχρι σφυρῶν: κατὰ δὲ τὸ τέρμα τῆς φλεβὸς ἧλος διήρειστο χαλκοῦς. οὗτος ὁ Τάλως τρὶς ἑκάστης ἡμέρας τὴν νῆσον περιτροχάζων ἐτήρει: διὸ καὶ τότε τὴν Ἀργὼ προσπλέουσαν θεωρῶν τοῖς λίθοις ἔβαλλεν. ἐξαπατηθεὶς δὲ ὑπὸ Μηδείας ἀπέθανεν, ὡς μὲν ἔνιοι λέγουσι, διὰ φαρμάκων αὐτῷ μανίαν Μηδείας ἐμβαλούσης, ὡς δέ τινες, ὑποσχομένης ποιήσειν ἀθάνατον καὶ τὸν ἧλον ἐξελούσης, ἐκρυέντος τοῦ παντὸς ἰχῶρος αὐτὸν ἀποθανεῖν. τινὲς δὲ αὐτὸν τοξευθέντα ὑπὸ Ποίαντος εἰς τὸ σφυρὸν τελευτῆσαι λέγουσι.μίαν δὲ ἐνταῦθα νύκτα μείναντες Αἰγίνῃ προσίσχουσιν ὑδρεύσασθαι θέλοντες, καὶ γίνεται περὶ τῆς ὑδρείας αὐτοῖς ἅμιλλα. ἐκεῖθεν δὲ διὰ τῆς Εὐβοίας καὶ τῆς Λοκρίδος πλεύσαντες εἰς Ἰωλκὸν ἦλθον, τὸν πάντα πλοῦν ἐν τέτταρσι μησὶ τελειώσαντες.

[26] Sailing by night they encountered a violent storm, and Apollo, taking his stand on the Melantian ridges, flashed lightning down, shooting a shaft into the sea. Then they perceived an island close at hand, and anchoring there they named it Anaphe, because it had loomed up （anaphanenai） unexpectedly. So they founded an altar of Radiant Apollo, and having offered sacrifice they betook them to feasting; and twelve handmaids, whom Arete had given to Medea, jested merrily with the chiefs; whence it is still customary for the women to jest at the sacrifice.Putting to sea from there, they were hindered from touching at Crete by Talos. Some say that he was a man of the Brazen Race, others that he was given to Minos by Hephaestus; he was a brazen man, but some say that he was a bull. He had a single vein extending from his neck to his ankles, and a bronze nail was rammed home at the end of the vein. This Talos kept guard, running round the island thrice every day; wherefore, when he saw the Argo standing inshore, he pelted it as usual with stones. His death was brought about by the wiles of Medea, whether, as some say, she drove him mad by drugs, or, as others say, she promised to make him immortal and then drew out the nail, so that all the ichor gushed out and he died. But some say that Poeas shot him dead in the ankle.After tarrying a single night there they put in to Aegina to draw water, and a contest arose among them concerning the drawing of the water. Thence they sailed betwixt Euboea and Locris and came to Iolcus, having completed the whole voyage in four months.

[27] Πελίας δὲ ἀπογνοὺς τὴν ὑποστροφὴν τῶν Ἀργοναυτῶν τὸν Αἴσονα κτείνειν ἤθελεν: ὁ δὲ αἰτησάμενος ἑαυτὸν ἀνελεῖν θυσίαν ἐπιτελῶν ἀδεῶς τοῦ ταυρείου σπασάμενος αἵματος ἀπέθανεν. ἡ δὲ Ἰάσονος μήτηρ ἐπαρασαμένη Πελίᾳ, νήπιον ἀπολιποῦσα παῖδα Πρόμαχον ἑαυτὴν ἀνήρτησε: Πελίας δὲ καὶ τὸν αὐτῇ καταλειφθέντα παῖδα ἀπέκτεινεν. ὁ δὲ Ἰάσων κατελθὼν τὸ μὲν δέρας ἔδωκε, περὶ ὧν δὲ ἠδικήθη μετελθεῖν ἐθέλων καιρὸν ἐξεδέχετο. καὶ τότε μὲν εἰς Ἰσθμὸν μετὰ τῶν ἀριστέων πλεύσας ἀνέθηκε τὴν ναῦν Ποσειδῶνι, αὖθις δὲ Μήδειαν παρακαλεῖ ζητεῖν ὅπως Πελίας αὐτῷ δίκας ὑπόσχῃ. ἡ δὲ εἰς τὰ βασίλεια τοῦ Πελίου παρελθοῦσα πείθει τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτοῦ τὸν πατέρα κρεουργῆσαι καὶ καθεψῆσαι, διὰ φαρμάκων αὐτὸν ἐπαγγελλομένη ποιήσειν νέον: καὶ τοῦ πιστεῦσαι χάριν κριὸν μελίσασα καὶ καθεψήσασα ἐποίησεν ἄρνα. αἱ δὲ πιστεύσασαι τὸν πατέρα κρεουργοῦσι καὶ καθέψουσιν. Ἄκαστος δὲ μετὰ τῶν τὴν Ἰωλκὸν οἰκούντων τὸν πατέρα θάπτει, τὸν δὲ Ἰάσονα μετὰ τῆς Μηδείας τῆς Ἰωλκοῦ ἐκβάλλει.

[27] Now Pelias, despairing of the return of the Argonauts, would have killed Aeson; but he requested to be allowed to take his own life, and in offering a sacrifice drank freely of the bull’s blood and died. And Jason’s mother cursed Pelias and hanged herself, leaving behind an infant son Promachus; but Pelias slew even the son whom she had left behind. On his return Jason surrendered the fleece, but though he longed to avenge his wrongs he bided his time. At that time he sailed with the chiefs to the Isthmus and dedicated the ship to Poseidon, but afterwards he exhorted Medea to devise how he could punish Pelias. So she repaired to the palace of Pelias and persuaded his daughters to make mince meat of their father and boil him, promising to make him young again by her drugs; and to win their confidence she cut up a ram and made it into a lamb by boiling it. So they believed her, made mince meat of their father and boiled him. But Acastus buried his father with the help of the inhabitants of Iolcus, and he expelled Jason and Medea from Iolcus.

[28] οἱ δὲ ἧκον εἰς Κόρινθον, καὶ δέκα μὲν ἔτη διετέλουν εὐτυχοῦντες, αὖθις δὲ τοῦ τῆς Κορίνθου βασιλέως Κρέοντος τὴν θυγατέρα Γλαύκην Ἰάσονι ἐγγυῶντος, παραπεμψάμενος Ἰάσων Μήδειαν ἐγάμει. ἡ δέ, οὕς τε ὤμοσεν Ἰάσων θεοὺς ἐπικαλεσαμένη καὶ τὴν Ἰάσονος ἀχαριστίαν μεμψαμένη πολλάκις, τῇ μὲν γαμουμένῃ πέπλον μεμαγμένον φαρμάκοις ἔπεμψεν, ὃν ἀμφιεσαμένη μετὰ τοῦ βοηθοῦντος πατρὸς πυρὶ λάβρῳ κατεφλέχθη, τοὺς δὲ παῖδας οὓς εἶχεν ἐξ Ἰάσονος, Μέρμερον καὶ Φέρητα, ἀπέκτεινε, καὶ λαβοῦσα παρὰ Ἡλίου ἅρμα πτηνῶν δρακόντων ἐπὶ τούτου φεύγουσα ἦλθεν εἰς Ἀθήνας. λέγεται δὲ καὶ ὅτι φεύγουσα τοὺς παῖδας ἔτι νηπίους ὄντας κατέλιπεν, ἱκέτας καθίσασα ἐπὶ τὸν βωμὸν τῆς Ἥρας τῆς ἀκραίας: Κορίνθιοι δὲ αὐτοὺς ἀναστήσαντες κατετραυμάτισαν.Μήδεια δὲ ἧκεν εἰς Ἀθήνας, κἀκεῖ γαμηθεῖσα Αἰγεῖ παῖδα γεννᾷ Μῆδον. ἐπιβουλεύουσα δὲ ὕστερον Θησεῖ φυγὰς ἐξ Ἀθηνῶν μετὰ τοῦ παιδὸς ἐκβάλλεται. ἀλλ᾽ οὗτος μὲν πολλῶν κρατήσας βαρβάρων τὴν ὑφ᾽ ἑαυτὸν χώραν ἅπασαν Μηδίαν ἐκάλεσε, καὶ στρατευόμενος ἐπὶ Ἰνδοὺς ἀπέθανε: Μήδεια δὲ εἰς Κόλχους ἦλθεν ἄγνωστος, καὶ καταλαβοῦσα Αἰήτην ὑπὸ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ Πέρσου τῆς βασιλείας ἐστερημένον, κτείνασα τοῦτον τῷ πατρὶ τὴν βασιλείαν ἀποκατέστησεν.

[28] They went to Corinth, and lived there happily for ten years, till Creon, king of Corinth, betrothed his daughter Glauce to Jason, who married her and divorced Medea. But she invoked the gods by whom Jason had sworn, and after often upbraiding him with his ingratitude she sent the bride a robe steeped in poison, which when Glauce had put on, she was consumed with fierce fire along with her father, who went to her rescue. But Mermerus and Pheres, the children whom Medea had by Jason, she killed, and having got from the Sun a car drawn by winged dragons she fled on it to Athens. Another tradition is that on her flight she left behind her children, who were still infants, setting them as suppliants on the altar of Hera of the Height; but the Corinthians removed them and wounded them to death.Medea came to Athens, and being there married to Aegeus bore him a son Medus. Afterwards, however, plotting against Theseus, she was driven a fugitive from Athens with her son. But he conquered many barbarians and called the whole country under him Media, and marching against the Indians he met his death. And Medea came unknown to Colchis, and finding that Aeetes had been deposed by his brother Perses, she killed Perses and restored the kingdom to her father.

### CHAPTER I

[1] ἐπειδὴ δὲ τὸ τοῦ Δευκαλίωνος διεξεληλύθαμεν γένος, ἐχομένως λέγωμεν τὸ Ἰνάχειον.Ὠκεανοῦ καὶ Τηθύος γίνεται παῖς Ἴναχος, ἀφ᾽ οὗ ποταμὸς ἐν Ἄργει Ἴναχος καλεῖται. τούτου καὶ Μελίας τῆς Ὠκεανοῦ Φορωνεύς τε καὶ Αἰγιαλεὺς παῖδες ἐγένοντο. Αἰγιαλέως μὲν οὖν ἄπαιδος ἀποθανόντος ἡ χώρα ἅπασα Αἰγιάλεια ἐκλήθη, Φορωνεὺς δὲ ἁπάσης τῆς ὕστερον Πελοποννήσου προσαγορευθείσης δυναστεύων ἐκ Τηλεδίκης νύμφης Ἆπιν καὶ Νιόβην ἐγέννησεν. Ἆπις μὲν οὖν εἰς τυραννίδα τὴν ἑαυτοῦ μεταστήσας δύναμιν καὶ βίαιος ὢν τύραννος, ὀνομάσας ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ τὴν Πελοπόννησον Ἀπίαν, ὑπὸ Θελξίονος καὶ Τελχῖνος ἐπιβουλευθεὶς ἄπαις ἀπέθανε, καὶ νομισθεὶς θεὸς ἐκλήθη Σάραπις: Νιόβης δὲ καὶ Διός （ᾗ πρώτῃ γυναικὶ Ζεὺς θνητῇ ἐμίγη） παῖς Ἄργος ἐγένετο, ὡς δὲ Ἀκουσίλαός φησι, καὶ Πελασγός, ἀφ᾽ οὗ κληθῆναι τοὺς τὴν Πελοπόννησον οἰκοῦντας Πελασγούς. Ἡσίοδος δὲ τὸν Πελασγὸν αὐτόχθονά φησιν εἶναι.

[1] Having now gone through the family of Deucalion, we have next to speak of that of Inachus.Ocean and Tethys had a son Inachus, after whom a river in Argos is called Inachus. He and Melia, daughter of Ocean, had sons, Phoroneus, and Aegialeus. Aegialeus having died childless, the whole country was called Aegialia; and Phoroneus, reigning over the whole land afterwards named Peloponnese, begat Apis and Niobe by a nymph Teledice. Apis converted his power into a tyranny and named the Peloponnese after himself Apia; but being a stern tyrant he was conspired against and slain by Thelxion and Telchis. He left no child, and being deemed a god was called Sarapis. But Niobe had by Zeus （ and she was the first mortal woman with whom Zeus cohabited） a son Argus, and also, so says Acusilaus, a son Pelasgus, after whom the inhabitants of the Peloponnese were called Pelasgians. However, Hesiod says that Pelasgus was a son of the soil.

[2] ἀλλὰ περὶ μὲν τούτου πάλιν ἐροῦμεν: Ἄργος δὲ λαβὼν τὴν βασιλείαν ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ τὴν Πελοπόννησον ἐκάλεσεν Ἄργος, καὶ γήμας Εὐάδνην τὴν Στρυμόνος καὶ Νεαίρας ἐτέκνωσεν Ἔκβασον Πείραντα Ἐπίδαυρον Κρίασον, ὃς καὶ τὴν βασιλείαν παρέλαβεν.Ἐκβάσου δὲ Ἀγήνωρ γίνεται, τούτου δὲ Ἄργος ὁ πανόπτης λεγόμενος. εἶχε δὲ οὗτος ὀφθαλμοὺς μὲν ἐν παντὶ τῷ σώματι, ὑπερβάλλων δὲ δυνάμει τὸν μὲν τὴν Ἀρκαδίαν λυμαινόμενον ταῦρον ἀνελὼν τὴν τούτου δορὰν ἠμφιέσατο, Σάτυρον δὲ τοὺς Ἀρκάδας ἀδικοῦντα καὶ ἀφαιρούμενον τὰ βοσκήματα ὑποστὰς ἀπέκτεινε. λέγεται δὲ ὅτι καὶ τὴν Ταρτάρου καὶ Γῆς Ἔχιδναν, ἣ τοὺς παριόντας συνήρπαζεν, ἐπιτηρήσας κοιμωμένην ἀπέκτεινεν. ἐξεδίκησε δὲ καὶ τὸν Ἄπιδος φόνον, τοὺς αἰτίους ἀποκτείνας.

[2] About him I shall speak again. But Argus received the kingdom and called the Peloponnese after himself Argos; and having married Evadne, daughter of Strymon and Neaera, he begat Ecbasus, Piras, Epidaurus, and Criasus, who also succeeded to the kingdom.Ecbasus had a son Agenor, and Agenor had a son Argus, the one who is called the All-seeing. He had eyes in the whole of his body, and being exceedingly strong he killed the bull that ravaged Arcadia and clad himself in its hide; and when a satyr wronged the Arcadians and robbed them of their cattle, Argus withstood and killed him. It is said, too, that Echidna, daughter of Tartarus and Earth, who used to carry off passers-by, was caught asleep and slain by Argus. He also avenged the murder of Apis by putting the guilty to death.

[3] Ἄργου δὲ καὶ Ἰσμήνης τῆς Ἀσωποῦ παῖς Ἴασος, οὗ φασιν Ἰὼ γενέσθαι. Κάστωρ δὲ ὁ συγγράψας τὰ χρονικὰ καὶ πολλοὶ τῶν τραγικῶν Ἰνάχου τὴν Ἰὼ λέγουσιν: Ἡσίοδος δὲ καὶ Ἀκουσίλαος Πειρῆνος αὐτήν φασιν εἶναι. ταύτην ἱερωσύνην τῆς Ἥρας ἔχουσαν Ζεὺς ἔφθειρε. φωραθεὶς δὲ ὑφ᾽ Ἥρας τῆς μὲν κόρης ἁψάμενος εἰς βοῦν μετεμόρφωσε λευκήν, ἀπωμόσατο δὲ ταύτῃ μὴ συνελθεῖν: διό φησιν Ἡσίοδος οὐκ ἐπισπᾶσθαι τὴν ἀπὸ τῶν θεῶν ὀργὴν τοὺς γινομένους ὅρκους ὑπὲρ ἔρωτος. Ἥρα δὲ αἰτησαμένη παρὰ Διὸς τὴν βοῦν φύλακα αὐτῆς κατέστησεν Ἄργον τὸν πανόπτην, ὃν Φερεκύδης μὲν Ἀρέστορος λέγει, Ἀσκληπιάδης δὲ Ἰνάχου, Κέρκωψ δὲ Ἄργου καὶ Ἰσμήνης τῆς Ἀσωποῦ θυγατρός: Ἀκουσίλαος δὲ γηγενῆ αὐτὸν λέγει. οὗτος ἐκ τῆς ἐλαίας ἐδέσμευεν αὐτὴν ἥτις ἐν τῷ Μυκηναίων ὑπῆρχεν ἄλσει. Διὸς δὲ ἐπιτάξαντος Ἑρμῇ κλέψαι τὴν βοῦν, μηνύσαντος Ἱέρακος, ἐπειδὴ λαθεῖν οὐκ ἠδύνατο, λίθῳ βαλὼν ἀπέκτεινε τὸν Ἄργον, ὅθεν ἀργειφόντης ἐκλήθη. Ἥρα δὲ τῇ βοῒ οἶστρον ἐμβάλλει ἡ δὲ πρῶτον ἧκεν εἰς τὸν ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνης Ἰόνιον κόλπον κληθέντα, ἔπειτα διὰ τῆς Ἰλλυρίδος πορευθεῖσα καὶ τὸν Αἷμον ὑπερβαλοῦσα διέβη τὸν τότε μὲν καλούμενον πόρον Θρᾴκιον, νῦν δὲ ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνης Βόσπορον. ἀπελθοῦσα δὲ εἰς Σκυθίαν καὶ τὴν Κιμμερίδα γῆν, πολλὴν χέρσον πλανηθεῖσα καὶ πολλὴν διανηξαμένη θάλασσαν Εὐρώπης τε καὶ Ἀσίας, τελευταῖον ἧκεν εἰς Αἴγυπτον, ὅπου τὴν ἀρχαίαν μορφὴν ἀπολαβοῦσα γεννᾷ παρὰ τῷ Νείλῳ ποταμῷ Ἔπαφον παῖδα. τοῦτον δὲ Ἥρα δεῖται Κουρήτων ἀφανῆ ποιῆσαι: οἱ δὲ ἠφάνισαν αὐτόν. καὶ Ζεὺς μὲν αἰσθόμενος κτείνει Κούρητας, Ἰὼ δὲ ἐπὶ ζήτησιν τοῦ παιδὸς ἐτράπετο.πλανωμένη δὲ κατὰ τὴν Συρίαν ἅπασαν （ἐκεῖ γὰρ ἐμηνύετο ὅτι ἡ τοῦ Βυβλίων βασιλέως γυνὴ ἐτιθήνει τὸν υἱόν） καὶ τὸν Ἔπαφον εὑροῦσα, εἰς Αἴγυπτον ἐλθοῦσα ἐγαμήθη Τηλεγόνῳ τῷ βασιλεύοντι τότε Αἰγυπτίων. ἱδρύσατο δὲ ἄγαλμα Δήμητρος, ἣν ἐκάλεσαν Ἶσιν Αἰγύπτιοι, καὶ τὴν Ἰὼ Ἶσιν ὁμοίως προσηγόρευσαν.

[3] Argus and Ismene, daughter of Asopus, had a son Iasus, who is said to have been the father of Io. But the annalist Castor and many of the tragedians allege that Io was a daughter of Inachus; and Hesiod and Acusilaus say that she was a daughter of Piren. Zeus seduced her while she held the priesthood of Hera, but being detected by Hera he by a touch turned Io into a white cow and swore that he had not known her; wherefore Hesiod remarks that lover’s oaths do not draw down the anger of the gods. But Hera requested the cow from Zeus for herself and set Argus the All-seeing to guard it. Pherecydes says that this Argus was a son of Arestor; but Asclepiades says that he was a son of Inachus, and Cercops says that he was a son of Argus and Ismene, daughter of Asopus; but Acusilaus says that he was earth-born. He tethered her to the olive tree which was in the grove of the Mycenaeans. But Zeus ordered Hermes to steal the cow, and as Hermes could not do it secretly because Hierax had blabbed, he killed Argus by the cast of a stone; whence he was called Argiphontes. Hera next sent a gadfly to infest the cow, and the animal came first to what is called after her the Ionian gulf. Then she journeyed through Illyria and having traversed Mount Haemus she crossed what was then called the Thracian Straits but is now called after her the Bosphorus. And having gone away to Scythia and the Cimmerian land she wandered over great tracts of land and swam wide stretches of sea both in Europe and Asia until at last she came to Egypt, where she recovered her original form and gave birth to a son Epaphus beside the river Nile. Him Hera besought the Curetes to make away with, and make away with him they did. When Zeus learned of it, he slew the Curetes; but Io set out in search of the child. She roamed all over Syria, because there it was revealed to her that the wife of the king of Byblus was nursing her son; and having found Epaphus she came to Egypt and was married to Telegonus, who then reigned over the Egyptians. And she set up an image of Demeter, whom the Egyptians called Isis, and Io likewise they called by the name of Isis.

[4] Ἔπαφος δὲ βασιλεύων Αἰγυπτίων γαμεῖ Μέμφιν τὴν Νείλου θυγατέρα, καὶ ἀπὸ ταύτης κτίζει Μέμφιν πόλιν, καὶ τεκνοῖ θυγατέρα Λιβύην, ἀφ᾽ ἧς ἡ χώρα Λιβύη ἐκλήθη. Λιβύης δὲ καὶ Ποσειδῶνος γίνονται παῖδες δίδυμοι Ἀγήνωρ καὶ Βῆλος. Ἀγήνωρ μὲν οὖν εἰς Φοινίκην ἀπαλλαγεὶς ἐβασίλευσε, κἀκεῖ τῆς μεγάλης ῥίζης ἐγένετο γενεάρχης: ὅθεν ὑπερθησόμεθα περὶ τούτου. Βῆλος δὲ ὑπομείνας ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ βασιλεύει μὲν Αἰγύπτου, γαμεῖ δὲ Ἀγχινόην τὴν Νείλου θυγατέρα, καὶ αὐτῷ γίνονται παῖδες δίδυμοι, Αἴγυπτος καὶ Δαναός, ὡς δέ φησιν Εὐριπίδης, καὶ Κηφεὺς καὶ Φινεὺς προσέτι. Δαναὸν μὲν οὖν Βῆλος ἐν Λιβύῃ κατῴκισεν, Αἴγυπτον δὲ ἐν Ἀραβίᾳ, ὃς καὶ καταστρεψάμενος τὴν Μελαμπόδων χώραν ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ ὠνόμασεν Αἴγυπτον. γίνονται δὲ ἐκ πολλῶν γυναικῶν Αἰγύπτῳ μὲν παῖδες πεντήκοντα, θυγατέρες δὲ Δαναῷ πεντήκοντα. στασιασάντων δὲ αὐτῶν περὶ τῆς ἀρχῆς ὕστερον, Δαναὸς τοὺς Αἰγύπτου παῖδας δεδοικώς, ὑποθεμένης Ἀθηνᾶς αὐτῷ ναῦν κατεσκεύασε πρῶτος καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας ἐνθέμενος ἔφυγε. προσσχὼν δὲ Ῥόδῳ τὸ τῆς Λινδίας ἄγαλμα Ἀθηνᾶς ἱδρύσατο. ἐντεῦθεν δὲ ἧκεν εἰς Ἄργος, καὶ τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτῷ παραδίδωσι Γελάνωρ ὁ τότε βασιλεύων αὐτὸς δὲ κρατήσας τῆς χώρας ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ τοὺς ἐνοικοῦντας Δαναοὺς ὠνόμασε. ἀνύδρου δὲ τῆς χώρας ὑπαρχούσης, ἐπειδὴ καὶ τὰς πηγὰς ἐξήρανε Ποσειδῶν μηνίων Ἰνάχῳ διότι τὴν χώραν Ἥρας ἐμαρτύρησεν εἶναι, τὰς θυγατέρας ὑδρευσομένας ἔπεμψε. μία δὲ αὐτῶν Ἀμυμώνη ζητοῦσα ὕδωρ ῥίπτει βέλος ἐπὶ ἔλαφον καὶ κοιμωμένου Σατύρου τυγχάνει, κἀκεῖνος περιαναστὰς ἐπεθύμει συγγενέσθαι: Ποσειδῶνος δὲ ἐπιφανέντος ὁ Σάτυρος μὲν ἔφυγεν, Ἀμυμώνη δὲ τούτῳ συνευνάζεται, καὶ αὐτῇ Ποσειδῶν τὰς ἐν Λέρνῃ πηγὰς ἐμήνυσεν.

[4] Reigning over the Egyptians Epaphus married Memphis, daughter of Nile, founded and named the city of Memphis after her, and begat a daughter Libya, after whom the region of Libya was called. Libya had by Poseidon twin sons, Agenor and Belus. Agenor departed to Phoenicia and reigned there, and there he became the ancestor of the great stock; hence we shall defer our account of him. But Belus remained in Egypt, reigned over the country, and married Anchinoe, daughter of Nile, by whom he had twin sons, Egyptus and Danaus, but according to Euripides, he had also Cepheus and Phineus. Danaus was settled by Belus in Libya, and Egyptus in Arabia; but Egyptus subjugated the country of the Melampods and named it Egypt < after himself>. Both had children by many wives; Egyptus had fifty sons, and Danaus fifty daughters. As they afterwards quarrelled concerning the kingdom, Danaus feared the sons of Egyptus, and by the advice of Athena he built a ship, being the first to do so, and having put his daughters on board he fled. And touching at Rhodes he set up the image of Lindian Athena. Thence he came to Argos and the reigning king Gelanor surrendered the kingdom to him; < and having made himself master of the country he named the inhabitants Danai after himself>. But the country being waterless, because Poseidon had dried up even the springs out of anger at Inachus for testifying that the land belonged to Hera, Danaus sent his daughters to draw water. One of them, Amymone, in her search for water threw a dart at a deer and hit a sleeping satyr, and he, starting up, desired to force her; but Poseidon appearing on the scene, the satyr fled, and Amymone lay with Poseidon, and he revealed to her the springs at Lerna.

[5] οἱ δὲ Αἰγύπτου παῖδες ἐλθόντες εἰς Ἄργος τῆς τε ἔχθρας παύσασθαι παρεκάλουν καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτοῦ γαμεῖν ἠξίουν. Δαναὸς δὲ ἅμα μὲν ἀπιστῶν αὐτῶν τοῖς ἐπαγγέλμασιν, ἅμα δὲ καὶ μνησικακῶν περὶ τῆς φυγῆς, ὡμολόγει τοὺς γάμους καὶ διεκλήρου τὰς κόρας. Ὑπερμνήστραν μὲν οὖν τὴν πρεσβυτέραν ἐξεῖλον Λυγκεῖ καὶ Γοργοφόνην Πρωτεῖ: οὗτοι γὰρ ἐκ βασιλίδος γυναικὸς Ἀργυφίης ἐγεγόνεισαν Αἰγύπτῳ. τῶν δὲ λοιπῶν ἔλαχον Βούσιρις μὲν καὶ Ἐγκέλαδος καὶ Λύκος καὶ Δαΐφρων τὰς Δαναῷ γεννηθείσας ἐξ Εὐρώπης Αὐτομάτην Ἀμυμώνην Ἀγαυὴν Σκαιήν. αὗται δὲ ἐκ βασιλίδος ἐγένοντο Δαναῷ, ἐκ δὲ Ἐλεφαντίδος Γοργοφόνη καὶ Ὑπερμνήστρα.

[5] But the sons of Egyptus came to Argos, and exhorted Danaus to lay aside his enmity, and begged to marry his daughters. Now Danaus distrusted their professions and bore them a grudge on account of his exile; nevertheless he consented to the marriage and allotted the damsels among them. First, they picked out Hypermnestra as the eldest to be the wife of Lynceus, and Gorgophone to be the wife of Proteus; for Lynceus and Proteus had been borne to Egyptus by a woman of royal blood, Argyphia; but of the rest Busiris, Enceladus, Lycus, and Daiphron obtained by lot the daughters that had been borne to Danaus by Europe, to wit, Automate, Amymone, Agave, and Scaea. These daughters were borne to Danaus by a queen; but Gorgophone and Hypermnestra were borne to him by Elephantis. And Istrus got Hippodamia; Chalcodon got Rhodia; Agenor got Cleopatra; Chaetus got Asteria; Diocorystes got Hippodamia; Alces got Glauce; Alcmenor got Hippomedusa; Hippothous got Gorge; Euchenor got Iphimedusa; Hippolytus got Rhode. These ten sons were begotten on an Arabian woman; but the maidens were begotten on Hamadryad nymphs, some being daughters of Atlantia, and others of Phoebe. Agaptolemus got Pirene; Cercetes got Dorium; Eurydamas got Phartis; Aegius got Mnestra; Argius got Evippe; Archelaus got Anaxibia; Menemachus got Nelo. These seven sons were begotten on a Phoenician woman, and the maidens on an Ethiopian woman. The sons of Egyptus by Tyria got as their wives, without drawing lots, the daughters of Danaus by Memphis in virtue of the similarity of their names; thus Clitus got Clite; Sthenelus got Sthenele; Chrysippus got Chrysippe. The twelve sons of Egyptus by the Naiad nymph Caliadne cast lots for the daughters of Danaus by the Naiad nymph Polyxo: the sons were Eurylochus, Phantes, Peristhenes, Hermus, Dryas, Potamon, Cisseus, Lixus, Imbrus, Bromius, Polyctor, Chthonius; and the damsels were Autonoe, Theano, Electra, Cleopatra, Eurydice, Glaucippe, Anthelia, Cleodore, Evippe, Erato, Stygne, Bryce. The sons of Egyptus by Gorgo, cast lots for the daughters of Danaus by Pieria, and Periphas got Actaea, Oeneus got Podarce, Egyptus got Dioxippe, Menalces got Adite, Lampus got Ocypete, Idmon got Pylarge. The youngest sons of Egyptus were these: Idas got Hippodice; Daiphron got Adiante （ the mother who bore these damsels was Herse）; Pandion got Callidice; Arbelus got Oeme; Hyperbius got Celaeno; Hippocorystes got Hyperippe; the mother of these men was Hephaestine, and the mother of these damsels was Crino.When they had got their brides by lot, Danaus made a feast and gave his daughters daggers; and they slew their bridegrooms as they slept, all but Hypermnestra; for she saved Lynceus because he had respected her virginity: wherefore Danaus shut her up and kept her under ward. But the rest of the daugters of Danaus buried the heads of their bridegrooms in Lerna and paid funeral honors to their bodies in front of the city; and Athena and Hermes purified them at the command of Zeus. Danaus afterwards united Hypermnestra to Lynceus; and bestowed his other daughters on the victors in an athletic contest.Amymone had a son Nauplius by Poseidon. This Nauplius lived to a great age, and sailing the sea he used by beacon lights to lure to death such as he fell in with. It came to pass, therefore, that he himself died by that very death. But before his death he married a wife; according to the tragic poets, she was Clymene, daughter of Catreus; but according to the author of The Returns, she was Philyra; and according to Cercops she was Hesione. By her he had Palamedes, Oeax, and Nausimedon.

[1] Λυγκεὺς δὲ μετὰ Δαναὸν Ἄργους δυναστεύων ἐξ Ὑπερμνήστρας τεκνοῖ παῖδα Ἄβαντα. τούτου δὲ καὶ Ἀγλαΐας τῆς Μαντινέως δίδυμοι παῖδες ἐγένοντο Ἀκρίσιος καὶ Προῖτος. οὗτοι καὶ κατὰ γαστρὸς μὲν ἔτι ὄντες ἐστασίαζον πρὸς ἀλλήλους, ὡς δὲ ἀνετράφησαν, περὶ τῆς βασιλείας ἐπολέμουν, καὶ πολεμοῦντες εὗρον ἀσπίδας πρῶτοι. καὶ κρατήσας Ἀκρίσιος Προῖτον Ἄργους ἐξελαύνει. ὁ δ᾽ ἧκεν εἰς Λυκίαν πρὸς Ἰοβάτην, ὡς δέ τινές φασι, πρὸς Ἀμφιάνακτα: καὶ γαμεῖ τὴν τούτου θυγατέρα, ὡς μὲν Ὅμηρος, Ἄντειαν, ὡς δὲ οἱ τραγικοί, Σθενέβοιαν. κατάγει δὲ αὐτὸν ὁ κηδεστὴς μετὰ στρατοῦ Λυκίων, καὶ καταλαμβάνει Τίρυνθα, ταύτην αὐτῷ Κυκλώπων τειχισάντων. μερισάμενοι δὲ τὴν Ἀργείαν ἅπασαν κατῴκουν, καὶ Ἀκρίσιος μὲν Ἄργους βασιλεύει, Προῖτος δὲ Τίρυνθος.

[1] Lynceus reigned over Argos after Danaus and begat a son Abas by Hypermnestra; and Abas had twin sons Acrisius and Proetus by Aglaia, daughter of Mantineus. These two quarrelled with each other while they were still in the womb, and when they were grown up they waged war for the kingdom, and in the course of the war they were the first to invent shields. And Acrisius gained the mastery and drove Proetus from Argos; and Proetus went to Lycia to the court of Iobates or, as some say, of Amphianax, and married his daughter, whom Homer calls Antia, but the tragic poets call her Stheneboea. His in-law restored him to his own land with an army of Lycians, and he occupied Tiryns, which the Cyclopes had fortified for him. They divided the whole of the Argive territory between them and settled in it, Acrisius reigning over Argos and Proetus over Tiryns.

[2] καὶ γίνεται Ἀκρισίῳ μὲν ἐξ Εὐρυδίκης τῆς Λακεδαίμονος Δανάη, Προίτῳ δὲ ἐκ Σθενεβοίας Λυσίππη καὶ Ἰφινόη καὶ Ἰφιάνασσα. αὗται δὲ ὡς ἐτελειώθησαν, ἐμάνησαν, ὡς μὲν Ἡσίοδός φησιν, ὅτι τὰς Διονύσου τελετὰς οὐ κατεδέχοντο, ὡς δὲ Ἀκουσίλαος λέγει, διότι τὸ τῆς Ἥρας ξόανον ἐξηυτέλισαν. γενόμεναι δὲ ἐμμανεῖς ἐπλανῶντο ἀνὰ τὴν Ἀργείαν ἅπασαν, αὖθις δὲ τὴν Ἀρκαδίαν καὶ τὴν Πελοπόννησον διελθοῦσαι μετ᾽ ἀκοσμίας ἁπάσης διὰ τῆς ἐρημίας ἐτρόχαζον. Μελάμπους δὲ ὁ Ἀμυθάονος καὶ Εἰδομένης τῆς Ἄβαντος, μάντις ὢν καὶ τὴν διὰ φαρμάκων καὶ καθαρμῶν θεραπείαν πρῶτος εὑρηκώς, ὑπισχνεῖται θεραπεύειν τὰς παρθένους, εἰ λάβοι τὸ τρίτον μέρος τῆς δυναστείας. οὐκ ἐπιτρέποντος δὲ Προίτου θεραπεύειν ἐπὶ μισθοῖς τηλικούτοις, ἔτι μᾶλλον ἐμαίνοντο αἱ παρθένοι καὶ προσέτι μετὰ τούτων αἱ λοιπαὶ γυναῖκες: καὶ γὰρ αὗται τὰς οἰκίας ἀπολιποῦσαι τοὺς ἰδίους ἀπώλλυον παῖδας καὶ εἰς τὴν ἐρημίαν ἐφοίτων. προβαινούσης δὲ ἐπὶ πλεῖστον τῆς συμφορᾶς, τοὺς αἰτηθέντας μισθοὺς ὁ Προῖτος ἐδίδου. ὁ δὲ ὑπέσχετο θεραπεύειν ὅταν ἕτερον τοσοῦτον τῆς γῆς ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ λάβῃ Βίας. Προῖτος δὲ εὐλαβηθεὶς μὴ βραδυνούσης τῆς θεραπείας αἰτηθείη καὶ πλεῖον, θεραπεύειν συνεχώρησεν ἐπὶ τούτοις. Μελάμπους δὲ παραλαβὼν τοὺς δυνατωτάτους τῶν νεανιῶν μετ᾽ ἀλαλαγμοῦ καί τινος ἐνθέου χορείας ἐκ τῶν ὀρῶν αὐτὰς εἰς Σικυῶνα συνεδίωξε. κατὰ δὲ τὸν διωγμὸν ἡ πρεσβυτάτη τῶν θυγατέρων Ἰφινόη μετήλλαξεν: ταῖς δὲ λοιπαῖς τυχούσαις καθαρμῶν σωφρονῆσαι συνέβη. καὶ ταύτας μὲν ἐξέδοτο Προῖτος Μελάμποδι καὶ Βίαντι, παῖδα δ᾽ ὕστερον ἐγέννησε Μεγαπένθην.

[2] And Acrisius had a daughter Danae by Eurydice, daughter of Lacedaemon, and Proetus had daughters, Lysippe, Iphinoe, and Iphianassa, by Stheneboea. When these damsels were grown up, they went mad, according to Hesiod, because they would not accept the rites of Dionysus, but according to Acusilaus, because they disparaged the wooden image of Hera. In their madness they roamed over the whole Argive land, and afterwards, passing through Arcadia and the Peloponnese, they ran through the desert in the most disorderly fashion. But Melampus, son of Amythaon by Idomene, daughter of Abas, being a seer and the first to devise the cure by means of drugs and purifications, promised to cure the maidens if he should receive the third part of the sovereignty. When Proetus refused to pay so high a fee for the cure, the maidens raved more than ever, and besides that, the other women raved with them; for they also abandoned their houses, destroyed their own children, and flocked to the desert. Not until the evil had reached a very high pitch did Proetus consent to pay the stipulated fee, and Melampus promised to effect a cure whenever his brother Bias should receive just so much land as himself. Fearing that, if the cure were delayed, yet more would be demanded of him, Proetus agreed to let the physician proceed on these terms. So Melampus, taking with him the most stalwart of the young men, chased the women in a bevy from the mountains to Sicyon with shouts and a sort of frenzied dance. In the pursuit Iphinoe, the eldest of the daughters, expired; but the others were lucky enough to be purified and so to recover their wits. Proetus gave them in marriage to Melampus and Bias, and afterwards begat a son, Megapenthes.

[1] Βελλεροφόντης δὲ ὁ Γλαύκου τοῦ Σισύφου, κτείνας ἀκουσίως ἀδελφὸν Δηλιάδην, ὡς δέ τινές φασι Πειρῆνα, ἄλλοι δὲ Ἀλκιμένην, πρὸς Προῖτον ἐλθὼν καθαίρεται. καὶ αὐτοῦ Σθενέβοια ἔρωτα ἴσχει, καὶ προσπέμπει λόγους περὶ συνουσίας. τοῦ δὲ ἀπαρνουμένου, λέγει πρὸς Προῖτον ὅτι Βελλεροφόντης αὐτῇ περὶ φθορᾶς προσεπέμψατο λόγους. Προῖτος δὲ πιστεύσας ἔδωκεν ἐπιστολὰς αὐτῷ πρὸς Ἰοβάτην κομίσαι, ἐν αἷς ἐνεγέγραπτο Βελλεροφόντην ἀποκτεῖναι. Ἰοβάτης δὲ ἀναγνοὺς ἐπέταξεν αὐτῷ Χίμαιραν κτεῖναι, νομίζων αὐτὸν ὑπὸ τοῦ θηρίου διαφθαρήσεσθαι: ἦν γὰρ οὐ μόνον ἑνὶ ἀλλὰ πολλοῖς οὐκ εὐάλωτον, εἶχε δὲ προτομὴν μὲν λέοντος, οὐρὰν δὲ δράκοντος, τρίτην δὲ κεφαλὴν μέσην αἰγός, δι᾽ ἧς πῦρ ἀνίει. καὶ τὴν χώραν διέφθειρε, καὶ τὰ βοσκήματα ἐλυμαίνετο: μία γὰρ φύσις τριῶν θηρίων εἶχε δύναμιν. λέγεται δὲ καὶ τὴν Χίμαιραν ταύτην τραφῆναι μὲν ὑπὸ Ἀμισωδάρου, καθάπερ εἴρηκε καὶ Ὅμηρος, γεννηθῆναι δὲ ἐκ Τυφῶνος καὶ Ἐχίδνης, καθὼς Ἡσίοδος ἱστορεῖ.

[1] Bellerophon, son of Glaucus, son of Sisyphus, having accidentally killed his brother Deliades or, as some say, Piren, or, as others will have it, Alcimenes, came to Proetus and was purified. And Stheneboea fell in love with him, and sent him proposals for a meeting; and when he rejected them, she told Proetus that Bellerophon had sent her a vicious proposal. Proetus believed her, and gave him a letter to take to Iobates, in which it was written that he was to kill Bellerophon. Having read the letter, Iobates ordered him to kill the Chimera, believing that he would be destroyed by the beast, for it was more than a match for many, let alone one; it had the fore part of a lion, the tail of a dragon, and its third head, the middle one, was that of a goat, through which it belched fire. And it devastated the country and harried the cattle; for it was a single creature with the power of three beasts. It is said, too, that this Chimera was bred by Amisodarus, as Homer also affirms, and that it was begotten by Typhon on Echidna, as Hesiod relates.

[2] ἀναβιβάσας οὖν ἑαυτὸν ὁ Βελλεροφόντης ἐπὶ τὸν Πήγασον, ὃν εἶχεν ἵππον ἐκ Μεδούσης πτηνὸν γεγεννημένον καὶ Ποσειδῶνος, ἀρθεὶς εἰς ὕψος ἀπὸ τούτου κατετόξευσε τὴν Χίμαιραν. μετὰ δὲ τὸν ἀγῶνα τοῦτον ἐπέταξεν αὐτῷ Σολύμοις μαχεσθῆναι. ὡς δὲ ἐτελεύτησε καὶ τοῦτον, Ἀμαζόσιν ἐπέταξεν ἀγωνίσασθαι αὐτόν. ὡς δὲ καὶ ταύτας ἀπέκτεινε, τοὺς γενναιότητι Λυκίων διαφέρειν δοκοῦντας ἐπιλέξας ἐπέταξεν ἀποκτεῖναι λοχήσαντας. ὡς δὲ καὶ τούτους ἀπέκτεινε πάντας, θαυμάσας τὴν δύναμιν αὐτοῦ ὁ Ἰοβάτης τά τε γράμματα ἔδειξε καὶ παρ᾽ αὐτῷ μένειν ἠξίωσε: δοὺς δὲ τὴν θυγατέρα Φιλονόην καὶ θνήσκων τὴν βασιλείαν κατέλιπεν αὐτῷ.

[2] So Bellerophon mounted his winged steed Pegasus, offspring of Medusa and Poseidon, and soaring on high shot down the Chimera from the height. After that contest Iobates ordered him to fight the Solymi, and when he had finished that task also, he commanded him to combat the Amazons. And when he had killed them also, he picked out the reputed bravest of the Lycians and bade them lay an ambush and slay him. But when Bellerophon had killed them also to a man, Iobates, in admiration of his prowess, showed him the letter and begged him to stay with him; moreover he gave him his daughter Philonoe, and dying bequeathed to him the kingdom.

[1] Ἀκρισίῳ δὲ περὶ παίδων γενέσεως ἀρρένων χρηστηριαζομένῳ ὁ θεὸς ἔφη γενέσθαι παῖδα ἐκ τῆς θυγατρός, ὃς αὐτὸν ἀποκτενεῖ. δείσας δὲ ὁ Ἀκρίσιος τοῦτο, ὑπὸ γῆν θάλαμον κατασκευάσας χάλκεον τὴν Δανάην ἐφρούρει. ταύτην μέν, ὡς ἔνιοι λέγουσιν, ἔφθειρε Προῖτος, ὅθεν αὐτοῖς καὶ ἡ στάσις ἐκινήθη: ὡς δὲ ἔνιοί φασι, Ζεὺς μεταμορφωθεὶς εἰς χρυσὸν καὶ διὰ τῆς ὀροφῆς εἰς τοὺς Δανάης εἰσρυεὶς κόλπους συνῆλθεν. αἰσθόμενος δὲ Ἀκρίσιος ὕστερον ἐξ αὐτῆς γεγεννημένον Περσέα, μὴ πιστεύσας ὑπὸ Διὸς ἐφθάρθαι, τὴν θυγατέρα μετὰ τοῦ παιδὸς εἰς λάρνακα βαλὼν ἔρριψεν εἰς θάλασσαν. προσενεχθείσης δὲ τῆς λάρνακος Σερίφῳ Δίκτυς ἄρας ἀνέτρεφε τοῦτον.

[1] When Acrisius inquired of the oracle how he should get male children, the god said that his daughter would give birth to a son who would kill him. Fearing that, Acrisius built a brazen chamber under ground and there guarded Danae. However, she was seduced, as some say, by Proetus, whence arose the quarrel between them; but some say that Zeus had intercourse with her in the shape of a stream of gold which poured through the roof into Danae’s lap. When Acrisius afterwards learned that she had got a child Perseus, he would not believe that she had been seduced by Zeus, and putting his daughter with the child in a chest, he cast it into the sea. The chest was washed ashore on Seriphus, and Dictys took up the boy and reared him.

[2] βασιλεύων δὲ τῆς Σερίφου Πολυδέκτης ἀδελφὸς Δίκτυος, Δανάης ἐρασθείς, καὶ ἠνδρωμένου Περσέως μὴ δυνάμενος αὐτῇ συνελθεῖν, συνεκάλει τοὺς φίλους, μεθ᾽ ὧν καὶ Περσέα, λέγων ἔρανον συνάγειν ἐπὶ τοὺς Ἱπποδαμείας τῆς Οἰνομάου γάμους. τοῦ δὲ Περσέως εἰπόντος καὶ ἐπὶ τῇ κεφαλῇ τῆς Γοργόνος οὐκ ἀντερεῖν, παρὰ μὲν τῶν λοιπῶν ᾔτησεν ἵππους, παρὰ δὲ τοῦ Περσέως οὐ λαβὼν τοὺς ἵππους, ἐπέταξε τῆς Γοργόνος κομίζειν τὴν κεφαλήν. ὁ δὲ Ἑρμοῦ καὶ Ἀθηνᾶς προκαθηγουμένων ἐπὶ τὰς Φόρκου παραγίνεται θυγατέρας, Ἐνυὼ καὶ Πεφρηδὼ καὶ Δεινώ: ἦσαν δὲ αὗται Κητοῦς τε καὶ Φόρκου, Γοργόνων ἀδελφαί, γραῖαι ἐκ γενετῆς. ἕνα τε ὀφθαλμὸν αἱ τρεῖς καὶ ἕνα ὀδόντα εἶχον, καὶ ταῦτα παρὰ μέρος ἤμειβον ἀλλήλαις. ὧν κυριεύσας ὁ Περσεύς, ὡς ἀπῄτουν, ἔφη δώσειν ἂν ὑφηγήσωνται τὴν ὁδὸν τὴν ἐπὶ τὰς νύμφας φέρουσαν. αὗται δὲ αἱ νύμφαι πτηνὰ εἶχον πέδιλα καὶ τὴν κίβισιν, ἥν φασιν εἶναι πήραν: Πίνδαρος δὲ καὶ Ἡσίοδος ἐν Ἀσπίδι ἐπὶ τοῦ Περσέως: “πᾶν δὲ μετάφρενον εἶχε κάρα δεινοῖο πελώρου Γοργοῦς, ἀμφὶ δέ μιν κίβισις θέε. “ Hesiod, Shield of Hercules, 223-

[2] Polydectes, brother of Dictys, was then king of Seriphus and fell in love with Danae, but could not get access to her, because Perseus was grown to man’s estate. So he called together his friends, including Perseus, under the pretext of collecting contributions towards a wedding gift for Hippodamia, daughter of Oenomaus. Now Perseus having declared that he would not stick even at the Gorgon’s head, Polydectes required the others to furnish horses, and not getting horses from Perseus ordered him to bring the Gorgon’s head. So under the guidance of Hermes and Athena he made his way to the daughters of Phorcus, to wit, Enyo, Pephredo, and Dino; for Phorcus had them by Ceto, and they were sisters of the Gorgons, and old women from their birth. The three had but one eye and one tooth, and these they passed to each other in turn. Perseus got possession of the eye and the tooth, and when they asked them back, he said he would give them up if they would show him the way to the nymphs. Now these nymphs had winged sandals and the kibisis, which they say was a wallet. [ But Pindar and Hesiod in The Shield say of Perseus:—” “ But all his back had on the head of a dread monster,
< The Gorgon,> and round him ran the kibisis. “
“Hesiod, Shield of Hercules, 223-

[1] εἴρηται δὲ παρὰ τὸ κεῖσθαι ἐκεῖ ἐσθῆτα καὶ τὴν τροφήν. εἶχον δὲ καὶ τὴν Ἄϊδος κυνῆν. ὑφηγησαμένων δὲ τῶν Φορκίδων, ἀποδοὺς τόν τε ὀδόντα καὶ τὸν ὀφθαλμὸν αὐταῖς, καὶ παραγενόμενος πρὸς τὰς νύμφας, καὶ τυχὼν ὧν ἐσπούδαζε, τὴν μὲν κίβισιν περιεβάλετο, τὰ δὲ πέδιλα τοῖς σφυροῖς προσήρμοσε, τὴν δὲ κυνῆν τῇ κεφαλῇ ἐπέθετο. ταύτην ἔχων αὐτὸς μὲν οὓς ἤθελεν ἔβλεπεν, ὑπὸ ἄλλων δὲ οὐχ ἑωρᾶτο. λαβὼν δὲ καὶ παρὰ Ἑρμοῦ ἀδαμαντίνην ἅρπην, πετόμενος εἰς τὸν Ὠκεανὸν ἧκε καὶ κατέλαβε τὰς Γοργόνας κοιμωμένας. ἦσαν δὲ αὗται Σθενὼ Εὐρυάλη Μέδουσα. μόνη δὲ ἦν θνητὴ Μέδουσα: διὰ τοῦτο ἐπὶ τὴν ταύτης κεφαλὴν Περσεὺς ἐπέμφθη. εἶχον δὲ αἱ Γοργόνες κεφαλὰς μὲν περιεσπειραμένας φολίσι δρακόντων, ὀδόντας δὲ μεγάλους ὡς συῶν, καὶ χεῖρας χαλκᾶς, καὶ πτέρυγας χρυσᾶς, δι᾽ ὧν ἐπέτοντο. τοὺς δὲ ἰδόντας λίθους ἐποίουν. ἐπιστὰς οὖν αὐταῖς ὁ Περσεὺς κοιμωμέναις, κατευθυνούσης τὴν χεῖρα Ἀθηνᾶς, ἀπεστραμμένος καὶ βλέπων εἰς ἀσπίδα χαλκῆν, δι᾽ ἧς τὴν εἰκόνα τῆς Γοργόνος ἔβλεπεν, ἐκαρατόμησεν αὐτήν. ἀποτμηθείσης δὲ τῆς κεφαλῆς, ἐκ τῆς Γοργόνος ἐξέθορε Πήγασος πτηνὸς ἵππος, καὶ Χρυσάωρ ὁ Γηρυόνου πατήρ:

[1] The kibisis is so called because dress and food are deposited in it. ] They had also the cap < of Hades>. When the Phorcides had shown him the way, he gave them back the tooth and the eye, and coming to the nymphs got what he wanted. So he slung the wallet （kibisis） about him, fitted the sandals to his ankles, and put the cap on his head. Wearing it, he saw whom he pleased, but was not seen by others. And having received also from Hermes an adamantine sickle he flew to the ocean and caught the Gorgons asleep. They were Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa. Now Medusa alone was mortal; for that reason Perseus was sent to fetch her head. But the Gorgons had heads twined about with the scales of dragons, and great tusks like swine’s, and brazen hands, and golden wings, by which they flew; and they turned to stone such as beheld them. So Perseus stood over them as they slept, and while Athena guided his hand and he looked with averted gaze on a brazen shield, in which he beheld the image of the Gorgon, he beheaded her. When her head was cut off, there sprang from the Gorgon the winged horse Pegasus and Chrysaor, the father of Geryon; these she had by Poseidon.

[3] τούτους δὲ ἐγέννησεν ἐκ Ποσειδῶνος. ὁ μὲν οὖν Περσεὺς ἐνθέμενος εἰς τὴν κίβισιν τὴν κεφαλὴν τῆς Μεδούσης ὀπίσω πάλιν ἐχώρει, αἱ δὲ Γοργόνες ἐκ τῆς κοίτης ἀναστᾶσαι τὸν Περσέα ἐδίωκον, καὶ συνιδεῖν αὐτὸν οὐκ ἠδύναντο διὰ τὴν κυνῆν. ἀπεκρύπτετο γὰρ ὑπ᾽ αὐτῆς.παραγενόμενος δὲ εἰς Αἰθιοπίαν, ἧς ἐβασίλευε Κηφεύς, εὗρε τὴν τούτου θυγατέρα Ἀνδρομέδαν παρακειμένην βορὰν θαλασσίῳ κήτει. Κασσιέπεια γὰρ ἡ Κηφέως γυνὴ Νηρηίσιν ἤρισε περὶ κάλλους, καὶ πασῶν εἶναι κρείσσων ηὔχησεν: ὅθεν αἱ Νηρηίδες ἐμήνισαν, καὶ Ποσειδῶν αὐταῖς συνοργισθεὶς πλήμμυράν τε ἐπὶ τὴν χώραν ἔπεμψε καὶ κῆτος. Ἄμμωνος δὲ χρήσαντος τὴν ἀπαλλαγὴν τῆς συμφορᾶς, ἐὰν ἡ Κασσιεπείας θυγάτηρ Ἀνδρομέδα προτεθῇ τῷ κήτει βορά, τοῦτο ἀναγκασθεὶς ὁ Κηφεὺς ὑπὸ τῶν Αἰθιόπων ἔπραξε, καὶ προσέδησε τὴν θυγατέρα πέτρα. ταύτην θεασάμενος ὁ Περσεὺς καὶ ἐρασθεὶς ἀναιρήσειν ὑπέσχετο Κηφεῖ τὸ κῆτος, εἰ μέλλει σωθεῖσαν αὐτὴν αὐτῷ δώσειν γυναῖκα. ἐπὶ τούτοις γενομένων ὅρκων, ὑποστὰς τὸ κῆτος ἔκτεινε καὶ τὴν Ἀνδρομέδαν ἔλυσεν. ἐπιβουλεύοντος δὲ αὐτῷ Φινέως, ὃς ἦν ἀδελφὸς τοῦ Κηφέως ἐγγεγυημένος πρῶτος τὴν Ἀνδρομέδαν, μαθὼν τὴν ἐπιβουλήν, τὴν Γοργόνα δείξας μετὰ τῶν συνεπιβουλευόντων αὐτὸν ἐλίθωσε παραχρῆμα. παραγενόμενος δὲ εἰς Σέριφον, καὶ καταλαβὼν προσπεφευγυῖαν τοῖς βωμοῖς μετὰ τοῦ Δίκτυος τὴν μητέρα διὰ τὴν Πολυδέκτου βίαν, εἰσελθὼν εἰς τὰ βασίλεια, συγκαλέσαντος τοῦ Πολυδέκτου τοὺς φίλους ἀπεστραμμένος τὴν κεφαλὴν τῆς Γοργόνος ἔδειξε: τῶν δὲ ἰδόντων, ὁποῖον ἕκαστος ἔτυχε σχῆμα ἔχων, ἀπελιθώθη. καταστήσας δὲ τῆς Σερίφου Δίκτυν βασιλέα, ἀπέδωκε τὰ μὲν πέδιλα καὶ τὴν κίβισιν καὶ τὴν κυνῆν Ἑρμῇ, τὴν δὲ κεφαλὴν τῆς Γοργόνος Ἀθηνᾷ. Ἑρμῆς μὲν οὖν τὰ προειρημένα πάλιν ἀπέδωκε ταῖς νύμφαις, Ἀθηνᾶ δὲ ἐν μέσῃ τῇ ἀσπίδι τῆς Γοργόνος τὴν κεφαλὴν ἐνέθηκε. λέγεται δὲ ὑπ᾽ ἐνίων ὅτι δι᾽ Ἀθηνᾶν ἡ Μέδουσα ἐκαρατομήθη: φασὶ δὲ ὅτι καὶ περὶ κάλλους ἠθέλησεν ἡ Γοργὼ αὐτῇ συγκριθῆναι.

[3] So Perseus put the head of Medusa in the wallet （kibisis） and went back again; but the Gorgons started up from their slumber and pursued Perseus: but they could not see him on account of the cap, for he was hidden by it.Being come to Ethiopia, of which Cepheus was king, he found the king’s daughter Andromeda set out to be the prey of a sea monster. For Cassiepea, the wife of Cepheus, vied with the Nereids in beauty and boasted to be better than them all; hence the Nereids were angry, and Poseidon, sharing their wrath, sent a flood and a monster to invade the land. But Ammon having predicted deliverance from the calamity if Cassiepea’s daughter Andromeda were exposed as a prey to the monster, Cepheus was compelled by the Ethiopians to do it, and he bound his daughter to a rock. When Perseus beheld her, he loved her and promised Cepheus that he would kill the monster, if he would give him the rescued damsel to wife. These terms having been sworn to, Perseus withstood and slew the monster and released Andromeda. However, Phineus, who was a brother of Cepheus, and to whom Andromeda had been first betrothed, plotted against him; but Perseus discovered the plot, and by showing the Gorgon turned him and his fellow conspirators at once into stone. And having come to Seriphus he found that his mother and Dictys had taken refuge at the altars on account of the violence of Polydectes; so he entered the palace, where Polydectes had gathered his friends, and with averted face he showed the Gorgon’s head; and all who beheld it were turned to stone, each in the attitude which he happened to have struck. Having appointed Dictys king of Seriphus, he gave back the sandals and the wallet （kibisis） and the cap to Hermes, but the Gorgon’s head he gave to Athena. Hermes restored the aforesaid things to the nymphs and Athena inserted the Gorgon’s head in the middle of her shield. But it is alleged by some that Medusa was beheaded for Athena’s sake; and they say that the Gorgon was fain to match herself with the goddess even in beauty.

[4] Περσεὺς δὲ μετὰ Δανάης καὶ Ἀνδρομέδας ἔσπευδεν εἰς Ἄργος, ἵνα Ἀκρίσιον θεάσηται. ὁ δὲ τοῦτο μαθὼν καὶ δεδοικὼς. τὸν χρησμόν, ἀπολιπὼν Ἄργος εἰς τὴν Πελασγιῶτιν ἐχώρησε γῆν. Τευταμίδου δὲ τοῦ Λαρισσαίων βασιλέως ἐπὶ κατοιχομένῳ τῷ πατρὶ διατιθέντος γυμνικὸν ἀγῶνα, παρεγένετο καὶ ὁ Περσεὺς ἀγωνίσασθαι θέλων, ἀγωνιζόμενος δὲ πένταθλον, τὸν δίσκον ἐπὶ τὸν Ἀκρισίου πόδα βαλὼν παραχρῆμα ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτόν. αἰσθόμενος δὲ τὸν χρησμὸν τετελειωμένον τὸν μὲν Ἀκρίσιον ἔξω τῆς πόλεως ἔθαψεν, αἰσχυνόμενος δὲ εἰς Ἄργος ἐπανελθεῖν ἐπὶ τὸν κλῆρον τοῦ δι᾽ αὐτοῦ τετελευτηκότος, παραγενόμενος εἰς Τίρυνθα πρὸς τὸν Προίτου παῖδα Μεγαπένθην ἠλλάξατο, τούτῳ τε τὸ Ἄργος ἐνεχείρισε. καὶ Μεγαπένθης μὲν ἐβασίλευσεν Ἀργείων, Περσεὺς δὲ Τίρυνθος, προστειχίσας Μίδειαν καὶ Μυκήνας.

[4] Perseus hastened with Danae and Andromeda to Argos in order that he might behold Acrisius. But he, learning of this and dreading the oracle, forsook Argos and departed to the Pelasgian land. Now Teutamides, king of Larissa, was holding athletic games in honor of his dead father, and Perseus came to compete. He engaged in the pentathlum, but in throwing the quoit he struck Acrisius on the foot and killed him instantly. Perceiving that the oracle was fulfilled, he buried Acrisius outside the city, and being ashamed to return to Argos to claim the inheritance of him who had died by his hand, he went to Megapenthes, son of Proetus, at Tiryns and effected an exchange with him, surrendering Argos into his hands. So Megapenthes reigned over the Argives, and Perseus reigned over Tiryns, after fortifying also Midea and Mycenae.

[5] And he had sons by Andromeda: before he came to Greece he had Perses, whom he left behind with Cepheus （ and from him it is said that the kings of Persia are descended）; and in Mycenae he had Alcaeus and Sthenelus and Heleus and Mestor and Electryon, and a daughter Gorgophone, whom Perieres married.Alcaeus had a son Amphitryon and a daughter Anaxo by Astydamia, daughter of Pelops; but some say he had them by Laonome, daughter of Guneus, others that he had them by Hipponome, daughter of Menoeceus; and Mestor had Hippothoe by Lysidice, daughter of Pelops. This Hippothoe was carried off by Poseidon, who brought her to the Echinadian Islands, and there had intercourse with her, and begat Taphius, who colonized Taphos and called the people Teleboans, because he had gone far from his native land. And Taphius had a son Pterelaus, whom Poseidon made immortal by implanting a golden hair in his head. And to Pterelaus were born sons, to wit, Chromius, Tyrannus, Antiochus, Chersidamas, Mestor, and Eueres.Electryon married Anaxo, daughter of Alcaeus, and begat a daughter Alcmena, and sons, to wit, Stratobates, Gorgophonus, Phylonomus, Celaeneus, Amphimachus, Lysinomus, Chirimachus, Anactor, and Archelaus; and after these he had also a bastard son, Licymnius, by a Phrygian woman Midea.Sthenelus had daughters, Alcyone and Medusa, by Nicippe, daughter of Pelops; and he had afterwards a son Eurystheus, who reigned also over Mycenae. For when Hercules was about to be born, Zeus declared among the gods that the descendant of Perseus then about to be born would reign over Mycenae, and Hera out of jealousy persuaded the Ilithyias to retard Alcmena’s delivery, and contrived that Eurystheus, son of Sthenelus, should be born a seven-month child.

[6] Ἠλεκτρύονος δὲ βασιλεύοντος Μυκηνῶν, μετὰ Ταφίων οἱ Πτερελάου παῖδες ἐλθόντες τὴν Μήστορος ἀρχὴν τοῦ μητροπάτορος ἀπῄτουν, καὶ μὴ προσέχοντος Ἠλεκτρύονος ἀπήλαυνον τὰς βόας: ἀμυνομένων δὲ τῶν Ἠλεκτρύονος παίδων, ἐκ προκλήσεως ἀλλήλους ἀπέκτειναν. ἐσώθη δὲ τῶν Ἠλεκτρύονος παίδων Λικύμνιος ἔτι νέος ὑπάρχων, τῶν δὲ Πτερελάου Εὐήρης, ὃς καὶ τὰς ναῦς ἐφύλασσε. τῶν δὲ Ταφίων οἱ διαφυγόντες ἀπέπλευσαν τὰς ἐλαθείσας βόας ἑλόντες, καὶ παρέθεντο τῷ βασιλεῖ τῶν Ἠλείων Πολυξένῳ: Ἀμφιτρύων δὲ παρὰ Πολυξένου λυτρωσάμενος αὐτὰς ἤγαγεν εἰς Μυκήνας. ὁ δὲ Ἠλεκτρύων τὸν τῶν παίδων θάνατον βουλόμενος ἐκδικῆσαι, παραδοὺς τὴν βασιλείαν Ἀμφιτρύωνι καὶ τὴν θυγατέρα Ἀλκμήνην, ἐξορκίσας ἵνα μέχρι τῆς ἐπανόδου παρθένον αὐτὴν φυλάξῃ, στρατεύειν ἐπὶ Τηλεβόας διενοεῖτο. ἀπολαμβάνοντος δὲ αὐτοῦ τὰς βόας, μιᾶς ἐκθορούσης Ἀμφιτρύων ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν ἀφῆκεν ὃ μετὰ χεῖρας εἶχε ῥόπαλον, τὸ δὲ ἀποκρουσθὲν ἀπὸ τῶν κεράτων εἰς τὴν Ἠλεκτρύονος κεφαλὴν ἐλθὸν ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτόν. ὅθεν λαβὼν ταύτην τὴν πρόφασιν Σθένελος παντὸς Ἄργους ἐξέβαλεν Ἀμφιτρύωνα, καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν τῶν Μυκηνῶν καὶ τῆς Τίρυνθος αὐτὸς κατέσχε: τὴν δὲ Μίδειαν, μεταπεμψάμενος τοὺς Πέλοπος παῖδας Ἀτρέα καὶ Θυέστην, παρέθετο τούτοις.Ἀμφιτρύων δὲ σὺν Ἀλκμήνῃ καὶ Λικυμνίῳ παραγενόμενος ἐπὶ Θήβας ὑπὸ Κρέοντος ἡγνίσθη, καὶ δίδωσι τὴν ἀδελφὴν Περιμήδην Λικυμνίῳ. λεγούσης δὲ Ἀλκμήνης γαμηθήσεσθαι αὐτῷ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῆς ἐκδικήσαντι τὸν θάνατον, ὑποσχόμενος ἐπὶ Τηλεβόας στρατεύει Ἀμφιτρύων, καὶ παρεκάλει συλλαβέσθαι Κρέοντα. ὁ δὲ ἔφη στρατεύσειν, ἐὰν πρότερον ἐκεῖνος τὴν Καδμείαν τῆς ἀλώπεκος ἀπαλλάξῃ: ἔφθειρε γὰρ τὴν Καδμείαν ἀλώπηξ θηρίον. ὑποστάντος δὲ ὅμως εἱμαρμένον ἦν αὐτὴν μηδέ τινα καταλαβεῖν.

[6] When Electryon reigned over Mycenae, the sons of Pterelaus came with some Taphians and claimed the kingdom of Mestor, their maternal grandfather, and as Electryon paid no heed to the claim, they drove away his kine; and when the sons of Electryon stood on their defence, they challenged and slew each other. But of the sons of Electryon there survived Licymnius, who was still young; and of the sons of Pterelaus there survived Everes, who guarded the ships. Those of the Taphians who escaped sailed away, taking with them the cattle they had lifted, and entrusted them to Polyxenus, king of the Eleans; but Amphitryon ransomed them from Polyxenus and brought them to Mycenae. Wishing to avenge his sons’ death, Electryon purposed to make war on the Teleboans, but first he committed the kingdom to Amphitryon along with his daughter Alcmena, binding him by oath to keep her a virgin until his return. However, as he was receiving the cows back, one of them charged, and Amphitryon threw at her the club which he had in his hands. But the club rebounded from the cow’s horns and striking Electryon’s head killed him. Hence Sthenelus laid hold of this pretext to banish Amphitryon from the whole of Argos, while he himself seized the throne of Mycenae and Tiryns; and he entrusted Midea to Atreus and Thyestes, the sons of Pelops, whom he had sent for. 0Amphitryon went with Alcmena and Licymnius to Thebes and was purified by Creon and gave his sister Perimede to Licymnius. And as Alcmena said she would marry him when he had avenged her brothers’ death, Amphitryon engaged to do so, and undertook an expedition against the Teleboans, and invited Creon to assist him. Creon said he would join in the expedition if Amphitryon would first rid the Cadmea of the vixen; for a brute of a vixen was ravaging the Cadmea. But though Amphitryon undertook the task, it was fated that nobody should catch her.

[7] ἀδικουμένης δὲ τῆς χώρας, ἕνα τῶν ἀστῶν παῖδα οἱ Θηβαῖοι κατὰ μῆνα προετίθεσαν αὐτῇ, πολλοὺς ἁρπαξούσῃ, τοῦτ᾽ εἰ μὴ γένοιτο. ἀπαλλαγεὶς οὖν Ἀμφιτρύων εἰς Ἀθήνας πρὸς Κέφαλον τὸν Δηιονέως, συνέπειθεν ἐπὶ μέρει τῶν ἀπὸ Τηλεβοῶν λαφύρων ἄγειν ἐπὶ τὴν θήραν τὸν κύνα ὃν Πρόκρις ἤγαγεν ἐκ Κρήτης παρὰ Μίνωος λαβοῦσα: ἦν δὲ καὶ τούτῳ πεπρωμένον πᾶν, ὅ τι ἂν διώκῃ, λαμβάνειν. διωκομένης οὖν ὑπὸ τοῦ κυνὸς τῆς ἀλώπεκος, Ζεὺς ἀμφοτέρους λίθους ἐποίησεν. Ἀμφιτρύων δὲ ἔχων ἐκ μὲν Θορικοῦ τῆς Ἀττικῆς Κέφαλον συμμαχοῦντα, ἐκ δὲ Φωκέων Πανοπέα, ἐκ δὲ Ἕλους τῆς Ἀργείας Ἕλειον τὸν Περσέως, ἐκ δὲ Θηβῶν Κρέοντα, τὰς τῶν Ταφίων νήσους ἐπόρθει. ἄχρι μὲν οὖν ἔζη Πτερέλαος, οὐκ ἐδύνατο τὴν Τάφον ἑλεῖν: ὡς δὲ ἡ Πτερελάου θυγάτηρ Κομαιθὼ ἐρασθεῖσα Ἀμφιτρύωνος τὴν χρυσῆν τρίχα τοῦ πατρὸς ἐκ τῆς κεφαλῆς ἐξείλετο, Πτερελάου τελευτήσαντος ἐχειρώσατο τὰς νήσους ἁπάσας. τὴν μὲν οὖν Κομαιθὼ κτείνει Ἀμφιτρύων καὶ τὴν λείαν ἔχων εἰς Θήβας ἔπλει, καὶ τὰς νήσους Ἑλείῳ καὶ Κεφάλῳ δίδωσι. κἀκεῖνοι πόλεις αὐτῶν ἐπωνύμους κτίσαντες κατῴκησαν.

[7] As the country suffered thereby, the Thebans every month exposed a son of one of the citizens to the brute, which would have carried off many if that were not done. So Amphitryon betook him to Cephalus, son of Deioneus, at Athens, and persuaded him, in return for a share of the Teleboan spoils, to bring to the chase the dog which Procris had brought from Crete as a gift from Minos; for that dog was destined to catch whatever it pursued. So then, when the vixen was chased by the dog, Zeus turned both of them into stone. Supported by his allies, to wit, Cephalus from Thoricus in Attica, Panopeus from Phocis, Heleus, son of Perseus, from Helos in Argolis, and Creon from Thebes, Amphitryon ravaged the islands of the Taphians. Now, so long as Pterelaus lived, he could not take Taphos; but when Comaetho, daughter of Pterelaus, falling in love with Amphitryon, pulled out the golden hair from her father’s head, Pterelaus died, and Amphitryon subjugated all the islands. He slew Comaetho, and sailed with the booty to Thebes, and gave the islands to Heleus and Cephalus; and they founded cities named after themselves and dwelt in them.

[8] πρὸ τοῦ δὲ Ἀμφιτρύωνα παραγενέσθαι εἰς Θήβας Ζεύς, διὰ νυκτὸς ἐλθὼν καὶ τὴν μίαν τριπλασιάσας νύκτα, ὅμοιος Ἀμφιτρύωνι γενόμενος Ἀλκμήνῃ συνευνάσθη καὶ τὰ γενόμενα περὶ Τηλεβοῶν διηγήσατο. Ἀμφιτρύων δὲ παραγενόμενος, ὡς οὐχ ἑώρα φιλοφρονουμένην πρὸς αὐτὸν τὴν γυναῖκα, ἐπυνθάνετο τὴν αἰτίαν: εἰπούσης δὲ ὅτι τῇ προτέρᾳ νυκτὶ παραγενόμενος αὐτῇ συγκεκοίμηται, μανθάνει παρὰ Τειρεσίου τὴν γενομένην τοῦ Διὸς συνουσίαν. Ἀλκμήνη δὲ δύο ἐγέννησε παῖδας, Διὶ μὲν Ἡρακλέα, μιᾷ νυκτὶ πρεσβύτερον, Ἀμφιτρύωνι δὲ Ἰφικλέα. τοῦ δὲ παιδὸς ὄντος ὀκταμηνιαίου δύο δράκοντας ὑπερμεγέθεις Ἥρα ἐπὶ τὴν εὐνὴν ἔπεμψε, διαφθαρῆναι τὸ βρέφος θέλουσα. ἐπιβοωμένης δὲ Ἀλκμήνης Ἀμφιτρύωνα, Ἡρακλῆς διαναστὰς ἄγχων ἑκατέραις ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτοὺς διέφθειρε. Φερεκύδης δέ φησιν Ἀμφιτρύωνα, βουλόμενον μαθεῖν ὁπότερος ἦν τῶν παίδων ἐκείνου, τοὺς δράκοντας εἰς τὴν εὐνὴν ἐμβαλεῖν, καὶ τοῦ μὲν Ἰφικλέους φυγόντος τοῦ δὲ Ἡρακλέους ὑποστάντος μαθεῖν ὡς Ἰφικλῆς ἐξ αὐτοῦ γεγέννηται.

[8] But before Amphitryon reached Thebes, Zeus came by night and prolonging the one night threefold he assumed the likeness of Amphitryon and bedded with Alcmena and related what had happened concerning the Teleboans. But when Amphitryon arrived and saw that he was not welcomed by his wife, he inquired the cause; and when she told him that he had come the night before and slept with her, he learned from Tiresias how Zeus had enjoyed her. And Alcmena bore two sons, to wit, Hercules, whom she had by Zeus and who was the elder by one night, and Iphicles, whom she had by Amphitryon. When the child was eight months old, Hera desired the destruction of the babe and sent two huge serpents to the bed. Alcmena called Amphitryon to her help, but Hercules arose and killed the serpents by strangling them with both his hands. However, Pherecydes says that it was Amphitryon who put the serpents in the bed, because he would know which of the two children was his, and that when Iphicles fled, and Hercules stood his ground, he knew that Iphicles was begotten of his body.

[9] ἐδιδάχθη δὲ Ἡρακλῆς ἁρματηλατεῖν μὲν ὑπὸ Ἀμφιτρύωνος, παλαίειν δὲ ὑπὸ Αὐτολύκου, τοξεύειν δὲ ὑπὸ Εὐρύτου, ὁπλομαχεῖν δὲ ὑπὸ Κάστορος, κιθαρῳδεῖν δὲ ὑπὸ Λίνου. οὗτος δὲ ἦν ἀδελφὸς Ὀρφέως: ἀφικόμενος δὲ εἰς Θήβας καὶ Θηβαῖος γενόμενος ὑπὸ Ἡρακλέους τῇ κιθάρᾳ πληγεὶς ἀπέθανεν: ἐπιπλήξαντα γὰρ αὐτὸν ὀργισθεὶς ἀπέκτεινε. δίκην δὲ ἐπαγόντων τινῶν αὐτῷ φόνου, παρανέγνω νόμον Ῥαδαμάνθυος λέγοντος, ὃς ἂν ἀμύνηται τὸν χειρῶν ἀδίκων κατάρξαντα, ἀθῷον εἶναι, καὶ οὕτως ἀπελύθη. δείσας δὲ Ἀμφιτρύων μὴ πάλιν τι ποιήσῃ τοιοῦτον, ἔπεμψεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὰ βουφόρβια. κἀκεῖ τρεφόμενος μεγέθει τε καὶ ῥώμῃ πάντων διήνεγκεν. ἦν δὲ καὶ θεωρηθεὶς φανερὸς ὅτι Διὸς παῖς ἦν: τετραπηχυαῖον μὲν γὰρ εἶχε τὸ σῶμα, πυρὸς δ᾽ ἐξ ὀμμάτων ἔλαμπεν αἴγλην. οὐκ ἠστόχει δὲ οὔτε τοξεύων οὔτε ἀκοντίζων.ἐν δὲ τοῖς βουκολίοις ὑπάρχων ὀκτωκαιδεκαέτης τὸν Κιθαιρώνειον ἀνεῖλε λέοντα. οὗτος γὰρ ὁρμώμενος ἐκ τοῦ Κιθαιρῶνος τὰς Ἀμφιτρύωνος ἔφθειρε βόας καὶ τὰς Θεσπίου.

[9] Hercules was taught to drive a chariot by Amphitryon, to wrestle by Autolycus, to shoot with the bow by Eurytus, to fence by Castor, and to play the lyre by Linus. This Linus was a brother of Orpheus; he came to Thebes and became a Theban, but was killed by Hercules with a blow of the lyre; for being struck by him, Hercules flew into a rage and slew him. When he was tried for murder, Hercules quoted a law of Rhadamanthys, who laid it down that whoever defends himself against a wrongful aggressor shall go free, and so he was acquitted. But fearing he might do the like again, Amphitryon sent him to the cattle farm; and there he was nurtured and outdid all in stature and strength. Even by the look of him it was plain that he was a son of Zeus; for his body measured four cubits, and he flashed a gleam of fire from his eyes; and he did not miss, neither with the bow nor with the javelin.While he was with the herds and had reached his eighteenth year he slew the lion of Cithaeron, for that animal, sallying from Cithaeron, harried the kine of Amphitryon and of Thespius.

[10] βασιλεὺς δὲ ἦν οὗτος Θεσπιῶν, πρὸς ὃν ἀφίκετο Ἡρακλῆς ἑλεῖν βουλόμενος τὸν λέοντα. ὁ δὲ αὐτὸν ἐξένισε πεντήκοντα ἡμέρας, καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν θήραν ἐξιόντι νυκτὸς ἑκάστης μίαν συνεύναζε θυγατέρα （πεντήκοντα δὲ αὐτῷ ἦσαν ἐκ Μεγαμήδης γεγεννημέναι τῆς Ἀρνέου）: ἐσπούδαζε γὰρ πάσας ἐξ Ἡρακλέους τεκνοποιήσασθαι. Ἡρακλῆς δὲ μίαν νομίζων εἶναι τὴν ἀεὶ συνευναζομένην, συνῆλθε πάσαις. καὶ χειρωσάμενος τὸν λέοντα τὴν μὲν δορὰν ἠμφιέσατο, τῷ χάσματι δὲ ἐχρήσατο κόρυθι.

[10] Now this Thespius was king of Thespiae, and Hercules went to him when he wished to catch the lion. The king entertained him for fifty days, and each night, as Hercules went forth to the hunt, Thespius bedded one of his daughters with him（ fifty daughters having been borne to him by Megamede, daughter of Arneus）; for he was anxious that all of them should have children by Hercules. Thus Hercules, though he thought that his bed-fellow was always the same, had intercourse with them all. And having vanquished the lion, he dressed himself in the skin and wore the scalp as a helmet.

[11] ἀνακάμπτοντι δὲ αὐτῷ ἀπὸ τῆς θήρας συνήντησαν κήρυκες παρὰ Ἐργίνου πεμφθέντες, ἵνα παρὰ Θηβαίων τὸν δασμὸν λάβωσιν. ἐτέλουν δὲ Θηβαῖοι τὸν δασμὸν Ἐργίνῳ δι᾽ αἰτίαν τήνδε. Κλύμενον τὸν Μινυῶν βασιλέα λίθῳ βαλὼν Μενοικέως ἡνίοχος, ὄνομα Περιήρης, ἐν Ὀγχηστῷ Ποσειδῶνος τεμένει τιτρώσκει: ὁ δὲ κομισθεὶς εἰς Ὀρχομενὸν ἡμιθνὴς ἐπισκήπτει τελευτῶν Ἐργίνῳ τῷ παιδὶ ἐκδικῆσαι τὸν θάνατον αὐτοῦ. στρατευσάμενος δὲ Ἐργῖνος ἐπὶ Θήβας, κτείνας οὐκ ὀλίγους ἐσπείσατο μεθ᾽ ὅρκων, ὅπως πέμπωσιν αὐτῷ Θηβαῖοι δασμὸν ἐπὶ εἴκοσιν ἔτη, κατὰ ἔτος ἑκατὸν βόας. ἐπὶ τοῦτον τὸν δασμὸν εἰς Θήβας τοὺς κήρυκας ἀπιόντας συντυχὼν Ἡρακλῆς ἐλωβήσατο: ἀποτεμὼν γὰρ αὐτῶν τὰ ὦτα καὶ τὰς ῥῖνας, καὶ διὰ σχοινίων τὰς χεῖρας δήσας ἐκ τῶν τραχήλων, ἔφη τοῦτον Ἐργίνῳ καὶ Μινύαις δασμὸν κομίζειν. ἐφ᾽ οἷς ἀγανακτῶν ἐστράτευσεν ἐπὶ Θήβας. Ἡρακλῆς δὲ λαβὼν ὅπλα παρ᾽ Ἀθηνᾶς καὶ πολεμαρχῶν Ἐργῖνον μὲν ἔκτεινε, τοὺς δὲ Μινύας ἐτρέψατο καὶ τὸν δασμὸν διπλοῦν ἠνάγκασε Θηβαίοις φέρειν. συνέβη δὲ κατὰ τὴν μάχην Ἀμφιτρύωνα γενναίως μαχόμενον τελευτῆσαι. λαμβάνει δὲ Ἡρακλῆς παρὰ Κρέοντος ἀριστεῖον τὴν πρεσβυτάτην θυγατέρα Μεγάραν, ἐξ ἧς αὐτῷ παῖδες ἐγένοντο τρεῖς, Θηρίμαχος Κρεοντιάδης Δηικόων. τὴν δὲ νεωτέραν θυγατέρα Κρέων Ἰφικλεῖ δίδωσιν, ἤδη παῖδα Ἰόλαον ἔχοντι ἐξ Αὐτομεδούσης τῆς Ἀλκάθου. ἔγημε δὲ καὶ Ἀλκμήνην μετὰ τὸν Ἀμφιτρύωνος θάνατον Διὸς παῖς Ῥαδάμανθυς, κατῴκει δὲ ἐν Ὠκαλέαις τῆς Βοιωτίας πεφευγώς.προμαθὼν δὲ παρ᾽ Ἐυρύτου τὴν τοξικὴν Ἡρακλῆς ἔλαβε παρὰ Ἑρμοῦ μὲν ξίφος, παρ᾽ Ἀπόλλωνος δὲ τόξα, παρὰ δὲ Ἡφαίστου θώρακα χρυσοῦν, παρὰ δὲ Ἀθηνᾶς πέπλον: ῥόπαλον μὲν γὰρ αὐτὸς ἔτεμεν ἐκ Νεμέας.

[11] As he was returning from the hunt, there met him heralds sent by Erginus to receive the tribute from the Thebans. Now the Thebans paid tribute to Erginus for the following reason. Clymenus, king of the Minyans, was wounded with a cast of a stone by a charioteer of Menoeceus, named Perieres, in a precinct of Poseidon at Onchestus; and being carried dying to Orchomenus, he with his last breath charged his son Erginus to avenge his death. So Erginus marched against Thebes, and after slaughtering not a few of the Thebans he concluded a treaty with them, confirmed by oaths, that they should send him tribute for twenty years, a hundred kine every year. Falling in with the heralds on their way to Thebes to demand this tribute, Hercules outraged them; for he cut off their ears and noses and hands, and having fastened them by ropes from their necks, he told them to carry that tribute to Erginus and the Minyans. Indignant at this outrage, Erginus marched against Thebes. But Hercules, having received weapons from Athena and taken the command, killed Erginus, put the Minyans to flight, and compelled them to pay double the tribute to the Thebans. And it chanced that in the fight Amphitryon fell fighting bravely. And Hercules received from Creon his eldest daughter Megara as a prize of valor, and by her he had three sons, Therimachus, Creontiades, and Deicoon. But Creon gave his younger daughter to Iphicles, who already had a son Iolaus by Automedusa, daughter of Alcathus. And Rhadamanthys, son of Zeus, married Alcmena after the death of Amphitryon, and dwelt as an exile at Ocaleae in Boeotia.Having first learned from Eurytus the art of archery, Hercules received a sword from Hermes, a bow and arrows from Apollo, a golden breastplate from Hephaestus, and a robe from Athena; for he had himself cut a club at Nemea.

[12] μετὰ δὲ τὴν πρὸς Μινύας μάχην συνέβη αὐτῷ κατὰ ζῆλον Ἥρας μανῆναι, καὶ τούς τε ἰδίους παῖδας, οὓς ἐκ Μεγάρας εἶχεν, εἰς πῦρ ἐμβαλεῖν καὶ τῶν Ἰφικλέους δύο: διὸ καταδικάσας ἑαυτοῦ φυγὴν καθαίρεται μὲν ὑπὸ Θεσπίου, παραγενόμενος δὲ εἰς Δελφοὺς πυνθάνεται τοῦ θεοῦ ποῦ κατοικήσει. ἡ δὲ Πυθία τότε πρῶτον Ἡρακλέα αὐτὸν προσηγόρευσε: τὸ δὲ πρώην Ἀλκείδης προσηγορεύετο. κατοικεῖν δὲ αὐτὸν εἶπεν ἐν Τίρυνθι, Εὐρυσθεῖ λατρεύοντα ἔτη δώδεκα, καὶ τοὺς ἐπιτασσομένους ἄθλους δέκα ἐπιτελεῖν, καὶ οὕτως ἔφη, τῶν ἄθλων συντελεσθέντων, ἀθάνατον αὐτὸν ἔσεσθαι.

[12] Now it came to pass that after the battle with the Minyans Hercules was driven mad through the jealousy of Hera and flung his own children, whom he had by Megara, and two children of Iphicles into the fire; wherefore he condemned himself to exile, and was purified by Thespius, and repairing to Delphi he inquired of the god where he should dwell. The Pythian priestess then first called him Hercules, for hitherto he was called Alcides. And she told him to dwell in Tiryns, serving Eurystheus for twelve years and to perform the ten labours imposed on him, and so, she said, when the tasks were accomplished, he would be immortal.

[1] τοῦτο ἀκούσας ὁ Ἡρακλῆς εἰς Τίρυνθα ἦλθε, καὶ τὸ προσταττόμενον ὑπὸ Εὐρυσθέως ἐτέλει. πρῶτον μὲν οὖν ἐπέταξεν αὐτῷ τοῦ Νεμέου λέοντος τὴν δορὰν κομίζειν: τοῦτο δὲ ζῷον ἦν ἄτρωτον, ἐκ Τυφῶνος γεγεννημένον. πορευόμενος οὖν ἐπὶ τὸν λέοντα ἦλθεν εἰς Κλεωνάς, καὶ ξενίζεται παρὰ ἀνδρὶ χερνήτῃ Μολόρχῳ. καὶ θύειν ἱερεῖον θέλοντι εἰς ἡμέραν ἔφη τηρεῖν τριακοστήν, καὶ ἂν μὲν ἀπὸ τῆς θήρας σῶος ἐπανέλθῃ, Διὶ σωτῆρι θύειν, ἐὰν δὲ ἀποθάνῃ, τότε ὡς ἥρωι ἐναγίζειν. εἰς δὲ τὴν Νεμέαν ἀφικόμενος καὶ τὸν λέοντα μαστεύσας ἐτόξευσε τὸ πρῶτον: ὡς δὲ ἔμαθεν ἄτρωτον ὄντα, ἀνατεινάμενος τὸ ῥόπαλον ἐδίωκε. συμφυγόντος δὲ εἰς ἀμφίστομον σπήλαιον αὐτοῦ τὴν ἑτέραν ἐνῳκοδόμησεν εἴσοδον, διὰ δὲ τῆς ἑτέρας ἐπεισῆλθε τῷ θηρίῳ, καὶ περιθεὶς τὴν χεῖρα τῷ τραχήλῳ κατέσχεν ἄγχων ἕως ἔπνιξε, καὶ θέμενος ἐπὶ τῶν ὤμων ἐκόμιζεν εἰς Κλεωνάς. καταλαβὼν δὲ τὸν Μόλορχον ἐν τῇ τελευταίᾳ τῶν ἡμερῶν ὡς νεκρῷ μέλλοντα τὸ ἱερεῖον ἐναγίζειν, σωτῆρι θύσας Διὶ ἦγεν εἰς Μυκήνας τὸν λέοντα. Εὐρυσθεὺς δὲ καταπλαγεὶς αὐτοῦ τὴν ἀνδρείαν ἀπεῖπε τὸ λοιπὸν αὐτῷ εἰς τὴν πόλιν εἰσιέναι, δεικνύειν δὲ πρὸ τῶν πυλῶν ἐκέλευε τοὺς ἄθλους. φασὶ δὲ ὅτι δείσας καὶ πίθον ἑαυτῷ χαλκοῦν εἰσκρυβῆναι ὑπὸ γῆν κατεσκεύασε, καὶ πέμπων κήρυκα Κοπρέα Πέλοπος τοῦ Ἠλείου ἐπέταττε τοὺς ἄθλους. οὗτος δὲ Ἴφιτον κτείνας, φυγὼν εἰς Μυκήνας καὶ τυχὼν παρ᾽ Εὐρυσθέως καθαρσίων ἐκεῖ κατῴκει.

[1] When Hercules heard that, he went to Tiryns and did as he was bid by Eurystheus. First, Eurystheus ordered him to bring the skin of the Nemean lion; now that was an invulnerable beast begotten by Typhon. On his way to attack the lion he came to Cleonae and lodged at the house of a day-laborer, Molorchus; and when his host would have offered a victim in sacrifice, Hercules told him to wait for thirty days, and then, if he had returned safe from the hunt, to sacrifice to Saviour Zeus, but if he were dead, to sacrifice to him as to a hero. And having come to Nemea and tracked the lion, he first shot an arrow at him, but when he perceived that the beast was invulnerable, he heaved up his club and made after him. And when the lion took refuge in a cave with two mouths, Hercules built up the one entrance and came in upon the beast through the other, and putting his arm round its neck held it tight till he had choked it; so laying it on his shoulders he carried it to Cleonae. And finding Molorchus on the last of the thirty days about to sacrifice the victim to him as to a dead man, he sacrificed to Saviour Zeus and brought the lion to Mycenae. Amazed at his manhood, Eurystheus forbade him thenceforth to enter the city, but ordered him to exhibit the fruits of his labours before the gates. They say, too, that in his fear he had a bronze jar made for himself to hide in under the earth, and that he sent his commands for the labours through a herald, Copreus, son of Pelops the Elean. This Copreus had killed Iphitus and fled to Mycenae, where he was purified by Eurystheus and took up his abode.

[2] δεύτερον δὲ ἆθλον ἐπέταξεν αὐτῷ τὴν Λερναίαν ὕδραν κτεῖναι: αὕτη δὲ ἐν τῷ τῆς Λέρνης ἕλει ἐκτραφεῖσα ἐξέβαινεν εἰς τὸ πεδίον καὶ τά τε βοσκήματα καὶ τὴν χώραν διέφθειρεν. εἶχε δὲ ἡ ὕδρα ὑπερμέγεθες σῶμα, κεφαλὰς ἔχον ἐννέα, τὰς μὲν ὀκτὼ θνητάς, τὴν δὲ μέσην ἀθάνατον. ἐπιβὰς οὖν ἅρματος, ἡνιοχοῦντος Ἰολάου, παρεγένετο εἰς τὴν Λέρνην, καὶ τοὺς μὲν ἵππους ἔστησε, τὴν δὲ ὕδραν εὑρὼν ἔν τινι λόφῳ παρὰ τὰς πηγὰς τῆς Ἀμυμώνης, ὅπου ὁ φωλεὸς αὐτῆς ὑπῆρχε, βάλλων βέλεσι πεπυρωμένοις ἠνάγκασεν ἐξελθεῖν, ἐκβαίνουσαν δὲ αὐτὴν κρατήσας κατεῖχεν. ἡ δὲ θατέρῳ τῶν ποδῶν ἐνείχετο περιπλακεῖσα. τῷ ῥοπάλῳ δὲ τὰς κεφαλὰς κόπτων οὐδὲν ἀνύειν ἠδύνατο: μιᾶς γὰρ κοπτομένης κεφαλῆς δύο ἀνεφύοντο. ἐπεβοήθει δὲ καρκίνος τῇ ὕδρᾳ ὑπερμεγέθης, δάκνων τὸν πόδα. διὸ τοῦτον ἀποκτείνας ἐπεκαλέσατο καὶ αὐτὸς βοηθὸν τὸν Ἰόλαον, ὃς μέρος τι καταπρήσας τῆς ἐγγὺς ὕλης τοῖς δαλοῖς ἐπικαίων τὰς ἀνατολὰς τῶν κεφαλῶν ἐκώλυεν ἀνιέναι. καὶ τοῦτον τὸν τρόπον τῶν ἀναφυομένων κεφαλῶν περιγενόμενος, τὴν ἀθάνατον ἀποκόψας κατώρυξε καὶ βαρεῖαν ἐπέθηκε πέτραν, παρὰ τὴν ὁδὸν τὴν φέρουσαν διὰ Λέρνης εἰς Ἐλαιοῦντα τὸ δὲ σῶμα τῆς ὕδρας ἀνασχίσας τῇ χολῇ τοὺς ὀιστοὺς ἔβαψεν. Εὐρυσθεὺς δὲ ἔφη μὴ δεῖν καταριθμῆσαι τοῦτον ἐν τοῖς δέκα τὸν ἆθλον: οὐ γὰρ μόνος ἀλλὰ καὶ μετὰ Ἰολάου τῆς ὕδρας περιεγένετο.

[2] As a second labour he ordered him to kill the Lernaean hydra. That creature, bred in the swamp of Lerna, used to go forth into the plain and ravage both the cattle and the country. Now the hydra had a huge body, with nine heads, eight mortal, but the middle one immortal. So mounting a chariot driven by Iolaus, he came to Lerna, and having halted his horses, he discovered the hydra on a hill beside the springs of the Amymone, where was its den. By pelting it with fiery shafts he forced it to come out, and in the act of doing so he seized and held it fast. But the hydra wound itself about one of his feet and clung to him. Nor could he effect anything by smashing its heads with his club, for as fast as one head was smashed there grew up two. A huge crab also came to the help of the hydra by biting his foot. So he killed it, and in his turn called for help on Iolaus who, by setting fire to a piece of the neighboring wood and burning the roots of the heads with the brands, prevented them from sprouting. Having thus got the better of the sprouting heads, he chopped off the immortal head, and buried it, and put a heavy rock on it, beside the road that leads through Lerna to Elaeus. But the body of the hydra he slit up and dipped his arrows in the gall. However, Eurystheus said that this labour should not be reckoned among the ten because he had not got the better of the hydra by himself, but with the help of Iolaus.

[3] τρίτον ἆθλον ἐπέταξεν αὐτῷ τὴν Κερυνῖτιν ἔλαφον εἰς Μυκήνας ἔμπνουν ἐνεγκεῖν. ἦν δὲ ἡ ἔλαφος ἐν Οἰνόῃ, χρυσόκερως, Ἀρτέμιδος ἱερά: διὸ καὶ βουλόμενος αὐτὴν Ἡρακλῆς μήτε ἀνελεῖν μήτε τρῶσαι, συνεδίωξεν ὅλον ἐνιαυτόν. ἐπεὶ δὲ κάμνον τὸ θηρίον τῇ διώξει συνέφυγεν εἰς ὄρος τὸ λεγόμενον Ἀρτεμίσιον, κἀκεῖθεν ἐπὶ ποταμὸν Λάδωνα, τοῦτον διαβαίνειν μέλλουσαν τοξεύσας συνέλαβε, καὶ θέμενος ἐπὶ τῶν ὤμων διὰ τῆς Ἀρκαδίας ἠπείγετο. μετ᾽ Ἀπόλλωνος δὲ Ἄρτεμις συντυχοῦσα ἀφῃρεῖτο, καὶ τὸ ἱερὸν ζῷον αὐτῆς κτείνοντα κατεμέμφετο. ὁ δὲ ὑποτιμησάμενος τὴν ἀνάγκην, καὶ τὸν αἴτιον εἰπὼν Εὐρυσθέα γεγονέναι, πραΰνας τὴν ὀργὴν τῆς θεοῦ τὸ θηρίον ἐκόμισεν ἔμπνουν εἰς Μυκήνας.

[3] As a third labour he ordered him to bring the Cerynitian hind alive to Mycenae. Now the hind was at Oenoe; it had golden horns and was sacred to Artemis; so wishing neither to kill nor wound it, Hercules hunted it a whole year. But when, weary with the chase, the beast took refuge on the mountain called Artemisius, and thence passed to the river Ladon, Hercules shot it just as it was about to cross the stream, and catching it put it on his shoulders and hastened through Arcadia. But Artemis with Apollo met him, and would have wrested the hind from him, and rebuked him for attempting to kill her sacred animal. Howbeit, by pleading necessity and laying the blame on Eurystheus, he appeased the anger of the goddess and carried the beast alive to Mycenae.

[4] τέταρτον ἆθλον ἐπέταξεν αὐτῷ τὸν Ἐρυμάνθιον κάπρον ζῶντα κομίζειν: τοῦτο δὲ τὸ θηρίον ἠδίκει τὴν Ψωφῖδα, ὁρμώμενον ἐξ ὄρους ὃ καλοῦσιν Ἐρύμανθον. διερχόμενος οὖν Φολόην ἐπιξενοῦται Κενταύρῳ Φόλῳ, Σειληνοῦ καὶ νύμφης μελίας παιδί. οὗτος Ἡρακλεῖ μὲν ὀπτὰ παρεῖχε τὰ κρέα, αὐτὸς δὲ ὠμοῖς ἐχρῆτο. αἰτοῦντος δὲ οἶνον Ἡρακλέους, ἔφη δεδοικέναι τὸν κοινὸν τῶν Κενταύρων ἀνοῖξαι πίθον: θαρρεῖν δὲ παρακελευσάμενος Ἡρακλῆς αὐτὸν ἤνοιξε, καὶ μετ᾽ οὐ πολὺ τῆς ὀσμῆς αἰσθόμενοι παρῆσαν οἱ Κένταυροι, πέτραις ὡπλισμένοι καὶ ἐλάταις, ἐπὶ τὸ τοῦ Φόλου σπήλαιον. τοὺς μὲν οὖν πρώτους τολμήσαντας εἴσω παρελθεῖν Ἄγχιον καὶ Ἄγριον Ἡρακλῆς ἐτρέψατο βάλλων δαλοῖς, τοὺς δὲ λοιποὺς ἐτόξευσε διώκων ἄχρι τῆς Μαλέας. ἐκεῖθεν δὲ πρὸς Χείρωνα συνέφυγον, ὃς ἐξελαθεὶς ὑπὸ Λαπιθῶν ὄρους Πηλίου παρὰ Μαλέαν κατῴκησε. τούτῳ περιπεπτωκότας τοὺς Κενταύρους τοξεύων ἵησι βέλος ὁ Ἡρακλῆς, τὸ δὲ ἐνεχθὲν Ἐλάτου διὰ τοῦ βραχίονος τῷ γόνατι τοῦ Χείρωνος ἐμπήγνυται. ἀνιαθεὶς δὲ Ἡρακλῆς προσδραμὼν τό τε βέλος ἐξείλκυσε, καὶ δόντος Χείρωνος φάρμακον ἐπέθηκεν. ἀνίατον δὲ ἔχων τὸ ἕλκος εἰς τὸ σπήλαιον ἀπαλλάσσεται. κἀκεῖ τελευτῆσαι βουλόμενος, καὶ μὴ δυνάμενος ἐπείπερ ἀθάνατος ἦν, ἀντιδόντος Διὶ Προμηθέως αὑτὸν ἀντ᾽ αὐτοῦ γενησόμενον ἀθάνατον, οὕτως ἀπέθανεν. οἱ λοιποὶ δὲ τῶν Κενταύρων φεύγουσιν ἄλλος ἀλλαχῇ, καὶ τινὲς μὲν παρεγένοντο εἰς ὄρος Μαλέαν, Εὐρυτίων δὲ εἰς Φολόην, Νέσσος δὲ ἐπὶ ποταμὸν Εὔηνον. τοὺς δὲ λοιποὺς ὑποδεξάμενος Ποσειδῶν εἰς Ἐλευσῖνα ὄρει κατεκάλυψεν. Φόλος δὲ ἑλκύσας ἐκ νεκροῦ τὸ βέλος ἐθαύμαζεν, εἰ τοὺς τηλικούτους τὸ μικρὸν διέφθειρε: τὸ δὲ τῆς χειρὸς ὀλισθῆσαν ἦλθεν ἐπὶ τὸν πόδα καὶ παραχρῆμα ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτόν. ἐπανελθὼν δὲ εἰς Φολόην Ἡρακλῆς καὶ Φόλον τελευτήσαντα θεασάμενος, θάψας αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὴν τοῦ κάπρου θήραν παραγίνεται, καὶ διώξας αὐτὸν ἔκ τινος λόχμης μετὰ κραυγῆς, εἰς χιόνα πολλὴν παρειμένον εἰσωθήσας ἐμβροχίσας τε ἐκόμισεν εἰς Μυκήνας.

[4] As a fourth labour he ordered him to bring the Erymanthian boar alive; now that animal ravaged Psophis, sallying from a mountain which they call Erymanthus. So passing through Pholoe he was entertained by the centaur Pholus, a son of Silenus by a Melian nymph. He set roast meat before Hercules, while he himself ate his meat raw. When Hercules called for wine, he said he feared to open the jar which belonged to the centaurs in common. But Hercules, bidding him be of good courage, opened it, and not long afterwards, scenting the smell, the centaurs arrived at the cave of Pholus, armed with rocks and firs. The first who dared to enter, Anchius and Agrius, were repelled by Hercules with a shower of brands, and the rest of them he shot and pursued as far as Malea. Thence they took refuge with Chiron, who, driven by the Lapiths from Mount Pelion, took up his abode at Malea. As the centaurs cowered about Chiron, Hercules shot an arrow at them, which, passing through the arm of Elatus, stuck in the knee of Chiron. Distressed at this, Hercules ran up to him, drew out the shaft, and applied a medicine which Chiron gave him. But the hurt proving incurable, Chiron retired to the cave and there he wished to die, but he could not, for he was immortal. However, Prometheus offered himself to Zeus to be immortal in his stead, and so Chiron died. The rest of the centaurs fled in different directions, and some came to Mount Malea, and Eurytion to Pholoe, and Nessus to the river Evenus. The rest of them Poseidon received at Eleusis and hid them in a mountain. But Pholus, drawing the arrow from a corpse, wondered that so little a thing could kill such big fellows; howbeit, it slipped from his hand and lighting on his foot killed him on the spot. So when Hercules returned to Pholoe, he beheld Pholus dead; and he buried him and proceeded to the boar hunt. And when he had chased the boar with shouts from a certain thicket, he drove the exhausted animal into deep snow, trapped it, and brought it to Mycenae.

[5] πέμπτον ἐπέταξεν αὐτῷ ἆθλον τῶν Αὐγείου βοσκημάτων ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ μόνον ἐκφορῆσαι τὴν ὄνθον. ἦν δὲ ὁ Αὐγείας βασιλεὺς Ἤλιδος, ὡς μέν τινες εἶπον, παῖς Ἡλίου, ὡς δέ τινες, Ποσειδῶνος, ὡς δὲ ἔνιοι, Φόρβαντος, πολλὰς δὲ εἶχε βοσκημάτων ποίμνας. τούτῳ προσελθὼν Ἡρακλῆς, οὐ δηλώσας τὴν Εὐρυσθέως ἐπιταγήν, ἔφασκε μιᾷ ἡμέρᾳ τὴν ὄνθον ἐκφορήσειν, εἰ δώσει τὴν δεκάτην αὐτῷ τῶν βοσκημάτων. Αὐγείας δὲ ἀπιστῶν ὑπισχνεῖται. μαρτυράμενος δὲ Ἡρακλῆς τὸν Αὐγείου παῖδα Φυλέα, τῆς τε αὐλῆς τὸν θεμέλιον διεῖλε καὶ τὸν Ἀλφειὸν καὶ τὸν Πηνειὸν σύνεγγυς ῥέοντας παροχετεύσας ἐπήγαγεν, ἔκρουν δι᾽ ἄλλης ἐξόδου ποιήσας. μαθὼν δὲ Αὐγείας ὅτι κατ᾽ ἐπιταγὴν Εὐρυσθέως τοῦτο ἐπιτετέλεσται, τὸν μισθὸν οὐκ ἀπεδίδου, προσέτι δ᾽ ἠρνεῖτο καὶ μισθὸν ὑποσχέσθαι δώσειν, καὶ κρίνεσθαι περὶ τούτου ἕτοιμος ἔλεγεν εἶναι. καθεζομένων δὲ τῶν δικαστῶν κληθεὶς ὁ Φυλεὺς ὑπὸ Ἡρακλέους τοῦ πατρὸς κατεμαρτύρησεν, εἰπὼν ὁμολογῆσαι μισθὸν δώσειν αὐτῷ. ὀργισθεὶς δὲ Αὐγείας, πρὶν τὴν ψῆφον ἐνεχθῆναι, τόν τε Φυλέα καὶ τὸν Ἡρακλέα βαδίζειν ἐξ Ἤλιδος ἐκέλευσε. Φυλεὺς μὲν οὖν εἰς Δουλίχιον ἦλθε κἀκεῖ κατῴκει, Ἡρακλῆς δὲ εἰς Ὤλενον πρὸς Δεξαμενὸν ἧκε, καὶ κατέλαβε τοῦτον μέλλοντα δι᾽ ἀνάγκην μνηστεύειν Εὐρυτίωνι Κενταύρῳ Μνησιμάχην τὴν θυγατέρα: ὑφ᾽ οὗ παρακληθεὶς βοηθεῖν ἐλθόντα ἐπὶ τὴν νύμφην Εὐρυτίωνα ἀπέκτεινεν. Εὐρυσθεὺς δὲ οὐδὲ τοῦτον ἐν τοῖς δέκα προσεδέξατο τὸν ἆθλον, λέγων ἐπὶ μισθῷ πεπρᾶχθαι.

[5] The fifth labour he laid on him was to carry out the dung of the cattle of Augeas in a single day. Now Augeas was king of Elis; some say that he was a son of the Sun, others that he was a son of Poseidon, and others that he was a son of Phorbas; and he had many herds of cattle. Hercules accosted him, and without revealing the command of Eurystheus, said that he would carry out the dung in one day, if Augeas would give him the tithe of the cattle. Augeas was incredulous, but promised. Having taken Augeas’s son Phyleus to witness, Hercules made a breach in the foundations of the cattle-yard, and then, diverting the courses of the Alpheus and Peneus, which flowed near each other, he turned them into the yard, having first made an outlet for the water through another opening. When Augeas learned that this had been accomplished at the command of Eurystheus, he would not pay the reward; nay more, he denied that he had promised to pay it, and on that point he professed himself ready to submit to arbitration. The arbitrators having taken their seats, Phyleus was called by Hercules and bore witness against his father, affirming that he had agreed to give him a reward. In a rage Augeas, before the voting took place, ordered both Phyleus and Hercules to pack out of Elis. So Phyleus went to Dulichium and dwelt there, and Hercules repaired to Dexamenus at Olenus. He found Dexamenus on the point of betrothing perforce his daughter Mnesimache to the centaur Eurytion, and being called upon by him for help, he slew Eurytion when that centaur came to fetch his bride. But Eurystheus would not admit this labour either among the ten, alleging that it had been performed for hire.

[6] ἕκτον ἐπέταξεν ἆθλον αὐτῷ τὰς Στυμφαλίδας ὄρνιθας ἐκδιῶξαι. ἦν δὲ ἐν Στυμφάλῳ πόλει τῆς Ἀρκαδίας Στυμφαλὶς λεγομένη λίμνη, πολλῇ συνηρεφὴς ὕλῃ: εἰς ταύτην ὄρνεις συνέφυγον ἄπλετοι, τὴν ἀπὸ τῶν λύκων ἁρπαγὴν δεδοικυῖαι. ἀμηχανοῦντος οὖν Ἡρακλέους πῶς ἐκ τῆς ὕλης τὰς ὄρνιθας ἐκβάλῃ, χάλκεα κρόταλα δίδωσιν αὐτῷ Ἀθηνᾶ παρὰ Ἡφαίστου λαβοῦσα. ταῦτα κρούων ἐπί τινος ὄρους τῇ λίμνῃ παρακειμένου τὰς ὄρνιθας ἐφόβει: αἱ δὲ τὸν δοῦπον οὐχ ὑπομένουσαι μετὰ δέους ἀνίπταντο, καὶ τοῦτον τὸν τρόπον Ἡρακλῆς ἐτόξευσεν αὐτάς.

[6] The sixth labour he enjoined on him was to chase away the Stymphalian birds. Now at the city of Stymphalus in Arcadia was the lake called Stymphalian, embosomed in a deep wood. To it countless birds had flocked for refuge, fearing to be preyed upon by the wolves. So when Hercules was at a loss how to drive the birds from the wood, Athena gave him brazen castanets, which she had received from Hephaestus. By clashing these on a certain mountain that overhung the lake, he scared the birds. They could not abide the sound, but fluttered up in a fright, and in that way Hercules shot them.

[7] ἕβδομον ἐπέταξεν ἆθλον τὸν Κρῆτα ἀγαγεῖν ταῦρον. τοῦτον Ἀκουσίλαος μὲν εἶναί φησι τὸν διαπορθμεύσαντα Εὐρώπην Διί, τινὲς δὲ τὸν ὑπὸ Ποσειδῶνος ἀναδοθέντα ἐκ θαλάσσης, ὅτε καταθύσειν Ποσειδῶνι Μίνως εἶπε τὸ φανὲν ἐκ τῆς θαλάσσης. καί φασι θεασάμενον αὐτὸν τοῦ ταύρου τὸ κάλλος τοῦτον μὲν εἰς τὰ βουκόλια ἀποπέμψαι, θῦσαι δὲ ἄλλον Ποσειδῶνι: ἐφ᾽ οἷς ὀργισθέντα τὸν θεὸν ἀγριῶσαι τὸν ταῦρον. ἐπὶ τοῦτον παραγενόμενος εἰς Κρήτην Ἡρακλῆς, ἐπειδὴ συλλαβεῖν ἀξιοῦντι Μίνως εἶπεν αὐτῷ λαμβάνειν διαγωνισαμένῳ, λαβὼν καὶ πρὸς Εὐρυσθέα διακομίσας ἔδειξε, καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν εἴασεν ἄνετον: ὁ δὲ πλανηθεὶς εἰς Σπάρτην τε καὶ Ἀρκαδίαν ἅπασαν, καὶ διαβὰς τὸν Ἰσθμόν, εἰς Μαραθῶνα τῆς Ἀττικῆς ἀφικόμενος τοὺς ἐγχωρίους διελυμαίνετο.

[7] The seventh labour he enjoined on him was to bring the Cretan bull. Acusilaus says that this was the bull that ferried across Europa for Zeus; but some say it was the bull that Poseidon sent up from the sea when Minos promised to sacrifice to Poseidon what should appear out of the sea. And they say that when he saw the beauty of the bull he sent it away to the herds and sacrificed another to Poseidon; at which the god was angry and made the bull savage. To attack this bull Hercules came to Crete, and when, in reply to his request for aid, Minos told him to fight and catch the bull for himself, he caught it and brought it to Eurystheus, and having shown it to him he let it afterwards go free. But the bull roamed to Sparta and all Arcadia, and traversing the Isthmus arrived at Marathon in Attica and harried the inhabitants.

[8] ὄγδοον ἆθλον ἐπέταξεν αὐτῷ τὰς Διομήδους τοῦ Θρακὸς ἵππους εἰς Μυκήνας κομίζειν: ἦν δὲ οὗτος Ἄρεος καὶ Κυρήνης, βασιλεὺς Βιστόνων ἔθνους Θρᾳκίου καὶ μαχιμωτάτου, εἶχε δὲ ἀνθρωποφάγους ἵππους. πλεύσας οὖν μετὰ τῶν ἑκουσίως συνεπομένων καὶ βιασάμενος τοὺς ἐπὶ ταῖς φάτναις τῶν ἵππων ὑπάρχοντας ἤγαγεν ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν. τῶν δὲ Βιστόνων σὺν ὅπλοις ἐπιβοηθούντων τὰς μὲν ἵππους παρέδωκεν Ἀβδήρῳ φυλάσσειν: οὗτος δὲ ἦν Ἑρμοῦ παῖς, Λοκρὸς ἐξ Ὀποῦντος, Ἡρακλέους ἐρώμενος, ὃν αἱ ἵπποι διέφθειραν ἐπισπασάμεναι: πρὸς δὲ τοὺς Βίστονας διαγωνισάμενος καὶ Διομήδην ἀποκτείνας τοὺς λοιποὺς ἠνάγκασε φεύγειν, καὶ κτίσας πόλιν Ἄβδηρα παρὰ τὸν τάφον τοῦ διαφθαρέντος Ἀβδήρου, τὰς ἵππους κομίσας Εὐρυσθεῖ ἔδωκε. μεθέντος δὲ αὐτὰς Εὐρυσθέως, εἰς τὸ λεγόμενον ὄρος Ὄλυμπον ἐλθοῦσαι πρὸς τῶν θηρίων ἀπώλοντο.

[8] The eighth labour he enjoined on him was to bring the mares of Diomedes the Thracian to Mycenae. Now this Diomedes was a son of Ares and Cyrene, and he was king of the Bistones, a very warlike Thracian people, and he owned man-eating mares. So Hercules sailed with a band of volunteers, and having overpowered the grooms who were in charge of the mangers, he drove the mares to the sea. When the Bistones in arms came to the rescue, he committed the mares to the guardianship of Abderus, who was a son of Hermes, a native of Opus in Locris, and a minion of Hercules; but the mares killed him by dragging him after them. But Hercules fought against the Bistones, slew Diomedes and compelled the rest to flee. And he founded a city Abdera beside the grave of Abderus who had been done to death, and bringing the mares he gave them to Eurystheus. But Eurystheus let them go, and they came to Mount Olympus, as it is called, and there they were destroyed by the wild beasts.

[9] ἔνατον ἆθλον Ἡρακλεῖ ἐπέταξε ζωστῆρα κομίζειν τὸν Ἱππολύτης. αὕτη δὲ ἐβασίλευεν Ἀμαζόνων, αἳ κατῴκουν περὶ τὸν Θερμώδοντα ποταμόν, ἔθνος μέγα τὰ κατὰ πόλεμον: ἤσκουν γὰρ ἀνδρίαν, καὶ εἴ ποτε μιγεῖσαι γεννήσειαν, τὰ θήλεα ἔτρεφον, καὶ τοὺς μὲν δεξιοὺς μαστοὺς ἐξέθλιβον, ἵνα μὴ κωλύωνται ἀκοντίζειν, τοὺς δὲ ἀριστεροὺς εἴων, ἵνα τρέφοιεν. εἶχε δὲ Ἱππολύτη τὸν Ἄρεος ζωστῆρα, σύμβολον τοῦ πρωτεύειν ἁπασῶν. ἐπὶ τοῦτον τὸν ζωστῆρα Ἡρακλῆς ἐπέμπετο, λαβεῖν αὐτὸν ἐπιθυμούσης τῆς Εὐρυσθέως θυγατρὸς Ἀδμήτης. παραλαβὼν οὖν ἐθελοντὰς συμμάχους ἐν μιᾷ νηὶ ἔπλει, καὶ προσίσχει νήσῳ Πάρῳ, ἣν κατῴκουν οἱ Μίνωος υἱοὶ Εὐρυμέδων Χρύσης Νηφαλίων Φιλόλαος. ἀποβάντων δὲ δύο τῶν ἐν τῇ νηὶ συνέβη τελευτῆσαι ὑπὸ τῶν Μίνωος υἱῶν: ὑπὲρ ὧν ἀγανακτῶν Ἡρακλῆς τούτους μὲν παραχρῆμα ἀπέκτεινε, τοὺς δὲ λοιποὺς κατακλείσας ἐπολιόρκει, ἕως ἐπιπρεσβευσάμενοι παρεκάλουν ἀντὶ τῶν ἀναιρεθέντων δύο λαβεῖν, οὓς ἂν αὐτὸς θελήσειεν. ὁ δὲ λύσας τὴν πολιορκίαν, καὶ τοὺς Ἀνδρόγεω τοῦ Μίνωος υἱοὺς ἀνελόμενος Ἀλκαῖον καὶ Σθένελον, ἧκεν εἰς Μυσίαν πρὸς Λύκον τὸν Δασκύλου, καὶ ξενισθεὶς ὑπὸ ... τοῦ Βεβρύκων βασιλέως συμβαλόντων, βοηθῶν Λύκῳ πολλοὺς ἀπέκτεινε, μεθ᾽ ὧν καὶ τὸν βασιλέα Μύγδονα, ἀδελφὸν Ἀμύκου. καὶ τῆς Βεβρύκων πολλὴν ἀποτεμόμενος γῆν ἔδωκε Λύκῳ: ὁ δὲ πᾶσαν ἐκείνην ἐκάλεσεν Ἡράκλειαν.καταπλεύσαντος δὲ εἰς τὸν ἐν Θεμισκύρᾳ λιμένα, παραγενομένης εἰς αὐτὸν Ἱππολύτης καὶ τίνος ἥκοι χάριν πυθομένης, καὶ δώσειν τὸν ζωστῆρα ὑποσχομένης, Ἥρα μιᾷ τῶν Ἀμαζόνων εἰκασθεῖσα τὸ πλῆθος ἐπεφοίτα, λέγουσα ὅτι τὴν βασιλίδα ἀφαρπάζουσιν οἱ προσελθόντες ξένοι. αἱ δὲ μεθ᾽ ὅπλων ἐπὶ τὴν ναῦν κατέθεον σὺν ἵπποις. ὡς δὲ εἶδεν αὐτὰς καθωπλισμένας Ἡρακλῆς, νομίσας ἐκ δόλου τοῦτο γενέσθαι, τὴν μὲν Ἱππολύτην κτείνας τὸν ζωστῆρα ἀφαιρεῖται, πρὸς δὲ τὰς λοιπὰς ἀγωνισάμενος ἀποπλεῖ, καὶ προσίσχει Τροίᾳ.συνεβεβήκει δὲ τότε κατὰ μῆνιν Ἀπόλλωνος καὶ Ποσειδῶνος ἀτυχεῖν τὴν πόλιν. Ἀπόλλων γὰρ καὶ Ποσειδῶν τὴν Λαομέδοντος ὕβριν πειράσαι θέλοντες, εἰκασθέντες ἀνθρώποις ὑπέσχοντο ἐπὶ μισθῷ τειχιεῖν τὸ Πέργαμον. τοῖς δὲ τειχίσασι τὸν μισθὸν οὐκ ἀπεδίδου. διὰ τοῦτο Ἀπόλλων μὲν λοιμὸν ἔπεμψε, Ποσειδῶν δὲ κῆτος ἀναφερόμενον ὑπὸ πλημμυρίδος, ὃ τοὺς ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ συνήρπαζεν ἀνθρώπους. χρησμῶν δὲ λεγόντων ἀπαλλαγὴν ἔσεσθαι τῶν συμφορῶν, ἐὰν προθῇ Λαομέδων Ἡσιόνην τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ τῷ κήτει βοράν, οὗτος προύθηκε ταῖς πλησίον τῆς θαλάσσης πέτραις προσαρτήσας. ταύτην ἰδὼν ἐκκειμένην Ἡρακλῆς ὑπέσχετο σώσειν, εἰ τὰς ἵππους παρὰ Λαομέδοντος λήψεται ἃς Ζεὺς ποινὴν τῆς Γανυμήδους ἁρπαγῆς ἔδωκε. δώσειν δὲ Λαομέδοντος εἰπόντος, κτείνας τὸ κῆτος Ἡσιόνην ἔσωσε. μὴ βουλομένου δὲ τὸν μισθὸν ἀποδοῦναι, πολεμήσειν Τροίᾳ ἀπειλήσας ἀνήχθη.καὶ προσίσχει Αἴνῳ, ἔνθα ξενίζεται ὑπὸ Πόλτυος. ἀποπλέων δὲ ἐπὶ τῆς ἠιόνος τῆς Αἰνίας Σαρπηδόνα, Ποσειδῶνος μὲν υἱὸν ἀδελφὸν δὲ Πόλτυος, ὑβριστὴν ὄντα τοξεύσας ἀπέκτεινε. καὶ παραγενόμενος εἰς Θάσον καὶ χειρωσάμενος τοὺς ἐνοικοῦντας Θρᾷκας ἔδωκε τοῖς Ἀνδρόγεω παισὶ κατοικεῖν. ἐκ Θάσου δὲ ὁρμηθεὶς ἐπὶ Τορώνην Πολύγονον καὶ Τηλέγονον, τοὺς Πρωτέως τοῦ Ποσειδῶνος υἱούς, παλαίειν προκαλουμένους κατὰ τὴν πάλην ἀπέκτεινε. κομίσας δὲ τὸν ζωστῆρα εἰς Μυκήνας ἔδωκεν Εὐρυσθεῖ.

[9] The ninth labour he enjoined on Hercules was to bring the belt of Hippolyte. She was queen of the Amazons, who dwelt about the river Thermodon, a people great in war; for they cultivated the manly virtues, and if ever they gave birth to children through intercourse with the other sex, they reared the females; and they pinched off the right breasts that they might not be trammelled by them in throwing the javelin, but they kept the left breasts, that they might suckle. Now Hippolyte had the belt of Ares in token of her superiority to all the rest. Hercules was sent to fetch this belt because Admete, daughter of Eurystheus, desired to get it. So taking with him a band of volunteer comrades in a single ship he set sail and put in to the island of Paros, which was inhabited by the sons of Minos, to wit, Eurymedon, Chryses, Nephalion, and Philolaus. But it chanced that two of those in the ship landed and were killed by the sons of Minos. Indignant at this, Hercules killed the sons of Minos on the spot and besieged the rest closely, till they sent envoys to request that in the room of the murdered men he would take two, whom he pleased. So he raised the siege, and taking on board the sons of Androgeus, son of Minos, to wit, Alcaeus and Sthenelus, he came to Mysia, to the court of Lycus, son of Dascylus, and was entertained by him; and in a battle between him and the king of the Bebryces Hercules sided with Lycus and slew many, amongst others King Mygdon, brother of Amycus. And he took much land from the Bebryces and gave it to Lycus, who called it all Heraclea.Having put in at the harbor of Themiscyra, he received a visit from Hippolyte, who inquired why he was come, and promised to give him the belt. But Hera in the likeness of an Amazon went up and down the multitude saying that the strangers who had arrived were carrying off the queen. So the Amazons in arms charged on horseback down on the ship. But when Hercules saw them in arms, he suspected treachery, and killing Hippolyte stripped her of her belt. And after fighting the rest he sailed away and touched at Troy.But it chanced that the city was then in distress consequently on the wrath of Apollo and Poseidon. For desiring to put the wantonness of Laomedon to the proof, Apollo and Poseidon assumed the likeness of men and undertook to fortify Pergamum for wages. But when they had fortified it, he would not pay them their wages. Therefore Apollo sent a pestilence, and Poseidon a sea monster, which, carried up by a flood, snatched away the people of the plain. But as oracles foretold deliverance from these calamities if Laomedon would expose his daughter Hesione to be devoured by the sea monster, he exposed her by fastening her to the rocks near the sea. Seeing her exposed, Hercules promised to save her on condition of receiving from Laomedon the mares which Zeus had given in compensation for the rape of Ganymede. On Laomedon’s saying that he would give them, Hercules killed the monster and saved Hesione. But when Laomedon would not give the stipulated reward, Hercules put to sea after threatening to make war on Troy.And he touched at Aenus, where he was entertained by Poltys. And as he was sailing away he shot and killed on the Aenian beach a lewd fellow, Sarpedon, son of Poseidon and brother of Poltys. And having come to Thasos and subjugated the Thracians who dwelt in the island, he gave it to the sons of Androgeus to dwell in. From Thasos he proceeded to Torone, and there, being challenged to wrestle by Polygonus and Telegonus, sons of Proteus, son of Poseidon, he killed them in the wrestling match. And having brought the belt to Mycenae he gave it to Eurystheus.

[10] δέκατον ἐπετάγη ἆθλον τὰς Γηρυόνου βόας ἐξ Ἐρυθείας κομίζειν. Ἐρύθεια δὲ ἦν Ὠκεανοῦ πλησίον κειμένη νῆσος, ἣ νῦν Γάδειρα καλεῖται. ταύτην κατῴκει Γηρυόνης Χρυσάορος καὶ Καλλιρρόης τῆς Ὠκεανοῦ, τριῶν ἔχων ἀνδρῶν συμφυὲς σῶμα, συνηγμένον εἰς ἓν κατὰ τὴν γαστέρα, ἐσχισμένον δὲ εἰς τρεῖς ἀπὸ λαγόνων τε καὶ μηρῶν. εἶχε δὲ φοινικᾶς βόας, ὧν ἦν βουκόλος Εὐρυτίων, φύλαξ δὲ Ὄρθος ὁ κύων δικέφαλος ἐξ Ἐχίδνης καὶ Τυφῶνος γεγεννημένος. πορευόμενος οὖν ἐπὶ τὰς Γηρυόνου βόας διὰ τῆς Εὐρώπης, ἄγρια πολλὰ ζῷα ἀνελὼν Λιβύης ἐπέβαινε, καὶ παρελθὼν Ταρτησσὸν ἔστησε σημεῖα τῆς πορείας ἐπὶ τῶν ὅρων Εὐρώπης καὶ Λιβύης ἀντιστοίχους δύο στήλας. θερόμενος δὲ ὑπὸ Ἡλίου κατὰ τὴν πορείαν, τὸ τόξον ἐπὶ τὸν θεὸν ἐνέτεινεν: ὁ δὲ τὴν ἀνδρείαν αὐτοῦ θαυμάσας χρύσεον ἔδωκε δέπας, ἐν ᾧ τὸν Ὠκεανὸν διεπέρασε. καὶ παραγενόμενος εἰς Ἐρύθειαν ἐν ὄρει Ἄβαντι αὐλίζεται. αἰσθόμενος δὲ ὁ κύων ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν ὥρμα: ὁ δὲ καὶ τοῦτον τῷ ῥοπάλῳ παίει, καὶ τὸν βουκόλον Εὐρυτίωνα τῷ κυνὶ βοηθοῦντα ἀπέκτεινε. Μενοίτης δὲ ἐκεῖ τὰς Ἅιδου βόας βόσκων Γηρυόνῃ τὸ γεγονὸς ἀπήγγειλεν. ὁ δὲ καταλαβὼν Ἡρακλέα παρὰ ποταμὸν Ἀνθεμοῦντα τὰς βόας ἀπάγοντα, συστησάμενος μάχην τοξευθεὶς ἀπέθανεν. Ἡρακλῆς δὲ ἐνθέμενος τὰς βόας εἰς τὸ δέπας καὶ διαπλεύσας εἰς Ταρτησσὸν Ἡλίῳ πάλιν ἀπέδωκε τὸ δέπας.διελθὼν δὲ Ἀβδηρίαν εἰς Λιγυστίνην ἦλθεν, ἐν ᾗ τὰς βόας ἀφῃροῦντο Ἰαλεβίων τε καὶ Δέρκυνος οἱ Ποσειδῶνος υἱοί, οὓς κτείνας διὰ Τυρρηνίας ᾔει. ἀπὸ Ῥηγίου δὲ εἷς ἀπορρήγνυσι ταῦρος, καὶ ταχέως εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν ἐμπεσὼν καὶ διανηξάμενος εἰς Σικελίαν, καὶ τὴν πλησίον χώραν διελθὼν τὴν ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνου κληθεῖσαν Ἰταλίαν （Τυρρηνοὶ γὰρ ἰταλὸν τὸν ταῦρον ἐκάλεσαν）, ἦλθεν εἰς πεδίον Ἔρυκος, ὃς ἐβασίλευεν Ἐλύμων.

[10] As a tenth labour he was ordered to fetch the kine of Geryon from Erythia. Now Erythia was an island near the ocean; it is now called Gadira. This island was inhabited by Geryon, son of Chrysaor by Callirrhoe, daughter of Ocean. He had the body of three men grown together and joined in one at the waist, but parted in three from the flanks and thighs. He owned red kine, of which Eurytion was the herdsman and Orthus, the two-headed hound, begotten by Typhon on Echidna, was the watchdog. So journeying through Europe to fetch the kine of Geryon he destroyed many wild beasts and set foot in Libya, and proceeding to Tartessus he erected as tokens of his journey two pillars over against each other at the boundaries of Europe and Libya. But being heated by the Sun on his journey, he bent his bow at the god, who in admiration of his hardihood, gave him a golden goblet in which he crossed the ocean. And having reached Erythia he lodged on Mount Abas. However the dog, perceiving him, rushed at him; but he smote it with his club, and when the herdsman Eurytion came to the help of the dog, Hercules killed him also. But Menoetes, who was there pasturing the kine of Hades, reported to Geryon what had occurred, and he, coming up with Hercules beside the river Anthemus, as he was driving away the kine, joined battle with him and was shot dead. And Hercules, embarking the kine in the goblet and sailing across to Tartessus, gave back the goblet to the Sun.And passing through Abderia he came to Liguria, where Ialebion and Dercynus, sons of Poseidon, attempted to rob him of the kine, but he killed them and went on his way through Tyrrhenia. But at Rhegium a bull broke away and hastily plunging into the sea swam across to Sicily, and having passed through the neighboring country since called Italy after it, for the Tyrrhenians called the bull italus, came to the plain of Eryx, who reigned over the Elymi. Now Eryx was a son of Poseidon, and he mingled the bull with his own herds. So Hercules entrusted the kine to Hephaestus and hurried away in search of the bull. He found it in the herds of Eryx, and when the king refused to surrender it unless Hercules should beat him in a wrestling bout, Hercules beat him thrice, killed him in the wrestling, and taking the bull drove it with the rest of the herd to the Ionian Sea. But when he came to the creeks of the sea, Hera afflicted the cows with a gadfly, and they dispersed among the skirts of the mountains of Thrace. Hercules went in pursuit, and having caught some, drove them to the Hellespont; but the remainder were thenceforth wild. Having with difficulty collected the cows, Hercules blamed the river Strymon, and whereas it had been navigable before, he made it unnavigable by filling it with rocks; and he conveyed the kine and gave them to Eurystheus, who sacrificed them to Hera.

[11] When the labours had been performed in eight years and a month, Eurystheus ordered Hercules, as an eleventh labour, to fetch golden apples from the Hesperides, for he did not acknowledge the labour of the cattle of Augeas nor that of the hydra. These apples were not, as some have said, in Libya, but on Atlas among the Hyperboreans. They were presented < by Earth> to Zeus after his marriage with Hera, and guarded by an immortal dragon with a hundred heads, offspring of Typhon and Echidna, which spoke with many and divers sorts of voices. With it the Hesperides also were on guard, to wit, Aegle, Erythia, Hesperia, and Arethusa. So journeying he came to the river Echedorus. And Cycnus, son of Ares and Pyrene, challenged him to single combat. Ares championed the cause of Cycnus and marshalled the combat, but a thunderbolt was hurled between the two and parted the combatants. And going on foot through Illyria and hastening to the river Eridanus he came to the nymphs, the daughters of Zeus and Themis. They revealed Nereus to him, and Hercules seized him while he slept, and though the god turned himself into all kinds of shapes, the hero bound him and did not release him till he had learned from him where were the apples and the Hesperides. Being informed, he traversed Libya. That country was then ruled by Antaeus, son of Poseidon, who used to kill strangers by forcing them to wrestle. Being forced to wrestle with him, Hercules hugged him, lifted him aloft, broke and killed him; for when he touched earth so it was that he waxed stronger, wherefore some said that he was a son of Earth.After Libya he traversed Egypt. That country was then ruled by Busiris, a son of Poseidon by Lysianassa, daughter of Epaphus. This Busiris used to sacrifice strangers on an altar of Zeus in accordance with a certain oracle. For Egypt was visited with dearth for nine years, and Phrasius, a learned seer who had come from Cyprus, said that the dearth would cease if they slaughtered a stranger man in honor of Zeus every year. Busiris began by slaughtering the seer himself and continued to slaughter the strangers who landed. So Hercules also was seized and haled to the altars, but he burst his bonds and slew both Busiris and his son Amphidamas.And traversing Asia he put in to Thermydrae, the harbor of the Lindians. And having loosed one of the bullocks from the cart of a cowherd, he sacrificed it and feasted. But the cowherd, unable to protect himself, stood on a certain mountain and cursed. Wherefore to this day, when they sacrifice to Hercules, they do it with curses.And passing by Arabia he slew Emathion, son of Tithonus, and journeying through Libya to the outer sea he received the goblet from the Sun. And having crossed to the opposite mainland he shot on the Caucasus the eagle, offspring of Echidna and Typhon, that was devouring the liver of Prometheus, and he released Prometheus, after choosing for himself the bond of olive, and to Zeus he presented Chiron, who, though immortal, consented to die in his stead.Now Prometheus had told Hercules not to go himself after the apples but to send Atlas, first relieving him of the burden of the sphere; so when he was come to Atlas in the land of the Hyperboreans, he took the advice and relieved Atlas. But when Atlas had received three apples from the Hesperides, he came to Hercules, and not wishing to support the sphere< he said that he would himself carry the apples to Eurystheus, and bade Hercules hold up the sky in his stead. Hercules promised to do so, but succeeded by craft in putting it on Atlas instead. For at the advice of Prometheus he begged Atlas to hold up the sky till he should> put a pad on his head. When Atlas heard that, he laid the apples down on the ground and took the sphere from Hercules. And so Hercules picked up the apples and departed. But some say that he did not get them from Atlas, but that he plucked the apples himself after killing the guardian snake. And having brought the apples he gave them to Eurystheus. But he, on receiving them, bestowed them on Hercules, from whom Athena got them and conveyed them back again; for it was not lawful that they should be laid down anywhere.

[12] δωδέκατον ἆθλον ἐπετάγη Κέρβερον ἐξ Ἅιδου κομίζειν. εἶχε δὲ οὗτος τρεῖς μὲν κυνῶν κεφαλάς, τὴν δὲ οὐρὰν δράκοντος, κατὰ δὲ τοῦ νώτου παντοίων εἶχεν ὄφεων κεφαλάς. μέλλων οὖν ἐπὶ τοῦτον ἀπιέναι ἦλθε πρὸς Εὔμολπον εἰς Ἐλευσῖνα, βουλόμενος μυηθῆναι ἦν δὲ οὐκ ἐξὸν ξένοις τότε μυεῖσθαι, ἐπειδήπερ θετὸς Πυλίου παῖς γενόμενος ἐμυεῖτο. μὴ δυνάμενος δὲ ἰδεῖν τὰ μυστήρια ἐπείπερ οὐκ ἦν ἡγνισμένος τὸν Κενταύρων φόνον, ἁγνισθεὶς ὑπὸ Εὐμόλπου τότε ἐμυήθη. καὶ παραγενόμενος ἐπὶ Ταίναρον τῆς Λακωνικῆς, οὗ τῆς Ἅιδου καταβάσεως τὸ στόμιόν ἐστι, διὰ τούτου κατῄει. ὁπηνίκα δὲ εἶδον αὐτὸν αἱ ψυχαί, χωρὶς Μελεάγρου καὶ Μεδούσης τῆς Γοργόνος ἔφυγον. ἐπὶ δὲ τὴν Γοργόνα τὸ ξίφος ὡς ζῶσαν ἕλκει, καὶ παρὰ Ἑρμοῦ μανθάνει ὅτι κενὸν εἴδωλόν ἐστι. πλησίον δὲ τῶν Ἅιδου πυλῶν γενόμενος Θησέα εὗρε καὶ Πειρίθουν τὸν Περσεφόνης μνηστευόμενον γάμον καὶ διὰ τοῦτο δεθέντα. θεασάμενοι δὲ Ἡρακλέα τὰς χεῖρας ὤρεγον ὡς ἀναστησόμενοι διὰ τῆς ἐκείνου βίας. ὁ δὲ Θησέα μὲν λαβόμενος τῆς χειρὸς ἤγειρε, Πειρίθουν δὲ ἀναστῆσαι βουλόμενος τῆς γῆς κινουμένης ἀφῆκεν. ἀπεκύλισε δὲ καὶ τὸν Ἀσκαλάφου πέτρον. βουλόμενος δὲ αἷμα ταῖς ψυχαῖς παρασχέσθαι, μίαν τῶν Ἅιδου βοῶν ἀπέσφαξεν. ὁ δὲ νέμων αὐτὰς Μενοίτης ὁ Κευθωνύμου προκαλεσάμενος εἰς πάλην Ἡρακλέα, ληφθεὶς μέσος καὶ τὰς πλευρὰς κατεαγεὶς ὑπὸ Περσεφόνης παρῃτήθη. αἰτοῦντος δὲ αὐτοῦ Πλούτωνα τὸν Κέρβερον, ἐπέταξεν ὁ Πλούτων ἄγειν χωρὶς ὧν εἶχεν ὅπλων κρατοῦντα. ὁ δὲ εὑρὼν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ ταῖς πύλαις τοῦ Ἀχέροντος, τῷ τε θώρακι συμπεφραγμένος καὶ τῇ λεοντῇ συσκεπασθείς, περιβαλὼν τῇ κεφαλῇ τὰς χεῖρας οὐκ ἀνῆκε κρατῶν καὶ ἄγχων τὸ θηρίον, ἕως ἔπεισε, καίπερ δακνόμενος ὑπὸ τοῦ κατὰ τὴν οὐρὰν δράκοντος. συλλαβὼν οὖν αὐτὸν ἧκε διὰ Τροιζῆνος ποιησάμενος τὴν ἀνάβασιν. Ἀσκάλαφον μὲν οὖν Δημήτηρ ἐποίησεν ὦτον, Ἡρακλῆς δὲ Εὐρυσθεῖ δείξας τὸν Κέρβερον πάλιν ἐκόμισεν εἰς Ἅιδου.

[12] A twelfth labour imposed on Hercules was to bring Cerberus from Hades. Now this Cerberus had three heads of dogs, the tail of a dragon, and on his back the heads of all sorts of snakes. When Hercules was about to depart to fetch him, he went to Eumolpus at Eleusis, wishing to be initiated. However it was not then lawful for foreigners to be initiated: since he proposed to be initiated as the adoptive son of Pylius. But not being able to see the mysteries because he had not been cleansed of the slaughter of the centaurs, he was cleansed by Eumolpus and then initiated. And having come to Taenarum in Laconia, where is the mouth of the descent to Hades, he descended through it. But when the souls saw him, they fled, save Meleager and the Gorgon Medusa. And Hercules drew his sword against the Gorgon, as if she were alive, but he learned from Hermes that she was an empty phantom. And being come near to the gates of Hades he found Theseus and Pirithous, him who wooed Persephone in wedlock and was therefore bound fast. And when they beheld Hercules, they stretched out their hands as if they should be raised from the dead by his might. And Theseus, indeed, he took by the hand and raised up, but when he would have brought up Pirithous, the earth quaked and he let go. And he rolled away also the stone of Ascalaphus. And wishing to provide the souls with blood, he slaughtered one of the kine of Hades. But Menoetes, son of Ceuthonymus, who tended the king, challenged Hercules to wrestle, and, being seized round the middle, had his ribs broken; howbeit, he was let off at the request of Persephone. When Hercules asked Pluto for Cerberus, Pluto ordered him to take the animal provided he mastered him without the use of the weapons which he carried. Hercules found him at the gates of Acheron, and, cased in his cuirass and covered by the lion’s skin, he flung his arms round the head of the brute, and though the dragon in its tail bit him, he never relaxed his grip and pressure till it yielded. So he carried it off and ascended through Troezen. But Demeter turned Ascalaphus into a short-eared owl, and Hercules, after showing Cerberus to Eurystheus, carried him back to Hades.

[1] μετὰ δὲ τοὺς ἄθλους Ἡρακλῆς ἀφικόμενος εἰς Θήβας Μεγάραν μὲν ἔδωκεν Ἰολάῳ, αὐτὸς δὲ γῆμαι θέλων ἐπυνθάνετο Εὔρυτον Οἰχαλίας δυνάστην ἆθλον προτεθεικέναι τὸν Ἰόλης τῆς θυγατρὸς γάμον τῷ νικήσαντι τοξικῇ αὐτόν τε καὶ τοὺς παῖδας αὐτῷ ὑπάρχοντας. ἀφικόμενος οὖν εἰς Οἰχαλίαν καὶ τῇ τοξικῇ κρείττων αὐτῶν γενόμενος οὐκ ἔτυχε τοῦ γάμου, Ἰφίτου μὲν τοῦ πρεσβυτέρου τῶν παίδων λέγοντος διδόναι τῷ Ἡρακλεῖ τὴν Ἰόλην, Εὐρύτου δὲ καὶ τῶν λοιπῶν ἀπαγορευόντων καὶ δεδοικέναι λεγόντων μὴ τεκνοποιησάμενος τὰ γεννηθησόμενα πάλιν ἀποκτείνῃ.

[1] After his labours Hercules went to Thebes and gave Megara to Iolaus, and, wishing himself to wed, he ascertained that Eurytus, prince of Oechalia, had proposed the hand of his daughter Iole as a prize to him who should vanquish himself and his sons in archery. So he came to Oechalia, and though he proved himself better than them at archery, yet he did not get the bride; for while Iphitus, the elder of Eurytus’s sons, said that Iole should be given to Hercules, Eurytus and the others refused, and said they feared that, if he got children, he would again kill his offspring.

[2] μετ᾽ οὐ πολὺ δὲ κλαπεισῶν ἐξ Εὐβοίας ὑπὸ Αὐτολύκου βοῶν, Εὔρυτος μὲν ἐνόμιζεν ὑφ᾽ Ἡρακλέους γεγονέναι τοῦτο, Ἴφιτος δὲ ἀπιστῶν ἀφικνεῖται πρὸς Ἡρακλέα, καὶ συντυχὼν ἥκοντι ἐκ Φερῶν αὐτῷ, σεσωκότι τὴν ἀποθανοῦσαν Ἄλκηστιν Ἀδμήτῳ, παρακαλεῖ συζητῆσαι τὰς βόας. Ἡρακλῆς δὲ ὑπισχνεῖται: καὶ ξενίζει μὲν αὐτόν, μανεὶς δὲ αὖθις ἀπὸ τῶν Τιρυνθίων ἔρριψεν αὐτὸν τειχῶν. καθαρθῆναι δὲ θέλων τὸν φόνον ἀφικνεῖται πρὸς Νηλέα: Πυλίων ἦν οὗτος δυνάστης. ἀπωσαμένου δὲ Νηλέως αὐτὸν διὰ τὴν πρὸς Εὔρυτον φιλίαν, εἰς Ἀμύκλας παραγενόμενος ὑπὸ Δηιφόβου τοῦ Ἱππολύτου καθαίρεται. κατασχεθεὶς δὲ δεινῇ νόσῳ διὰ τὸν Ἰφίτου φόνον, εἰς Δελφοὺς παραγενόμενος ἀπαλλαγὴν ἐπυνθάνετο τῆς νόσου. μὴ χρησμῳδούσης δὲ αὐτῷ τῆς Πυθίας τόν τε ναὸν συλᾶν ἤθελε, καὶ τὸν τρίποδα βαστάσας κατασκευάζειν μαντεῖον ἴδιον. μαχομένου δὲ αὐτῷ Ἀπόλλωνος, ὁ Ζεὺς ἵησι μέσον αὐτῶν κεραυνόν. καὶ τοῦτον διαλυθέντων τὸν τρόπον, λαμβάνει χρησμὸν Ἡρακλῆς, ὃς ἔλεγεν ἀπαλλαγὴν αὐτῷ τῆς νόσου ἔσεσθαι πραθέντι καὶ τρία ἔτη λατρεύσαντι καὶ δόντι ποινὴν τοῦ φόνου τὴν τιμὴν Εὐρύτῳ.

[2] Not long after, some cattle were stolen from Euboea by Autolycus, and Eurytus supposed that it was done by Hercules; but Iphitus did not believe it and went to Hercules. And meeting him, as he came from Pherae after saving the dead Alcestis for Admetus, he invited him to seek the kine with him. Hercules promised to do so and entertained him; but going mad again he threw him from the walls of Tiryns. Wishing to be purified of the murder he repaired to Neleus, who was prince of the Pylians. And when Neleus rejected his request on the score of his friendship with Eurytus, he went to Amyclae and was purified by Deiphobus, son of Hippolytus. But being afflicted with a dire disease on account of the murder of Iphitus he went to Delphi and inquired how he might be rid of the disease. As the Pythian priestess answered him not by oracles, he was fain to plunder the temple, and, carrying off the tripod, to institute an oracle of his own. But Apollo fought him, and Zeus threw a thunderbolt between them. When they had thus been parted, Hercules received an oracle, which declared that the remedy for his disease was for him to be sold, and to serve for three years, and to pay compensation for the murder to Eurytus.

[3] τοῦ δὲ χρησμοῦ δοθέντος Ἑρμῆς Ἡρακλέα πιπράσκει: καὶ αὐτὸν ὠνεῖται Ὀμφάλη Ἰαρδάνου, βασιλεύουσα Λυδῶν, ᾗ τὴν ἡγεμονίαν τελευτῶν ὁ γήμας Τμῶλος κατέλιπε. τὴν μὲν οὖν τιμὴν κομισθεῖσαν Εὔρυτος οὐ προσεδέξατο, Ἡρακλῆς δὲ Ὀμφάλῃ δουλεύων τοὺς μὲν περὶ τὴν Ἔφεσον Κέρκωπας συλλαβὼν ἔδησε, Συλέα δὲ ἐν Αὐλίδι τοὺς παριόντας ξένους σκάπτειν ἀναγκάζοντα, σὺν ταῖς ῥίζαις τὰς ἀμπέλους καύσας μετὰ τῆς θυγατρὸς Ξενοδόκης ἀπέκτεινε. καὶ προσσχὼν νήσῳ Δολίχῃ, τὸ Ἰκάρου σῶμα ἰδὼν τοῖς αἰγιαλοῖς προσφερόμενον ἔθαψε, καὶ τὴν νῆσον ἀντὶ Δολίχης Ἰκαρίαν ἐκάλεσεν. ἀντὶ τούτου Δαίδαλος ἐν Πίσῃ εἰκόνα παραπλησίαν κατεσκεύασεν Ἡρακλεῖ: ἣν νυκτὸς ἀγνοήσας Ἡρακλῆς λίθῳ βαλὼν ὡς ἔμπνουν ἔπληξε. καθ᾽ ὃν δὲ χρόνον ἐλάτρευε παρ᾽ Ὀμφάλῃ, λέγεται τὸν ἐπὶ Κόλχους πλοῦν γενέσθαι καὶ τὴν τοῦ Καλυδωνίου κάπρου θήραν, καὶ Θησέα παραγενόμενον ἐκ Τροιζῆνος τὸν Ἰσθμὸν καθᾶραι.

[3] After the delivery of the oracle, Hermes sold Hercules, and he was bought by Omphale, daughter of Iardanes, queen of Lydia, to whom at his death her husband Tmolus had bequeathed the government. Eurytus did not accept the compensation when it was presented to him, but Hercules served Omphale as a slave, and in the course of his servitude he seized and bound the Cercopes at Ephesus; and as for Syleus in Aulis, who compelled passing strangers to dig, Hercules killed him with his daughter Xenodoce, after burning the vines with the roots. And having put in to the island of Doliche, he saw the body of Icarus washed ashore and buried it, and he called the island Icaria instead of Doliche. In return Daedalus made a portrait statue of Hercules at Pisa, which Hercules mistook at night for living and threw a stone and hit it. And during the time of his servitude with Omphale it is said that the voyage to Colchis and the hunt of the Calydonian boar took place, and that Theseus on his way from Troezen cleared the Isthmus of malefactors.

[4] μετὰ δὲ τὴν λατρείαν ἀπαλλαγεὶς τῆς νόσου ἐπὶ Ἴλιον ἔπλει πεντηκοντόροις ὀκτωκαίδεκα, συναθροίσας στρατὸν ἀνδρῶν ἀρίστων ἑκουσίως θελόντων στρατεύεσθαι. καταπλεύσας δὲ εἰς Ἴλιον τὴν μὲν τῶν νεῶν φυλακὴν Ὀικλεῖ κατέλιπεν, αὐτὸς δὲ μετὰ τῶν ἄλλων ἀριστέων ὥρμα ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν. παραγενόμενος δὲ ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς σὺν τῷ πλήθει Λαομέδων Ὀικλέα μὲν ἀπέκτεινε μαχόμενον, ἀπελασθεὶς δὲ ὑπὸ τῶν μετὰ Ἡρακλέους ἐπολιορκεῖτο. τῆς δὲ πολιορκίας ἐνεστώσης ῥήξας τὸ τεῖχος Τελαμὼν πρῶτος εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὴν πόλιν, καὶ μετὰ τοῦτον Ἡρακλῆς. ὡς δὲ ἐθεάσατο Τελαμῶνα πρῶτον εἰσεληλυθότα, σπασάμενος τὸ ξίφος ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν ὥρμα, μηδένα θέλων ἑαυτοῦ κρείττονα νομίζεσθαι. συνιδὼν δὲ τοῦτο Τελαμὼν λίθους πλησίον κειμένους συνήθροιζε, τοῦ δὲ ἐρομένου τί πράττοι βωμὸν εἶπεν Ἡρακλέους κατασκευάζειν καλλινίκου. ὁ δὲ ἐπαινέσας; ὡς εἷλε τὴν πόλιν, κατατοξεύσας Λαομέδοντα καὶ τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ χωρὶς Ποδάρκου, Τελαμῶνι ἀριστεῖον Ἡσιόνην τὴν Λαομέδοντος θυγατέρα δίδωσι, καὶ ταύτῃ συγχωρεῖ τῶν αἰχμαλώτων ὃν ἤθελεν ἄγεσθαι. τῆς δὲ αἱρουμένης τὸν ἀδελφὸν Ποδάρκην, ἔφη δεῖν πρῶτον αὐτὸν δοῦλον γενέσθαι, καὶ τότε τί ποτε δοῦσαν ἀντ᾽ αὐτοῦ λαβεῖν αὐτόν. ἡ δὲ πιπρασκομένου τὴν καλύπτραν ἀφελομένη τῆς κεφαλῆς ἀντέδωκεν: ὅθεν Ποδάρκης Πρίαμος ἐκλήθη.

[4] After his servitude, being rid of his disease he mustered an army of noble volunteers and sailed for Ilium with eighteen ships of fifty oars each. And having come to port at Ilium, he left the guard of the ships to Oicles and himself with the rest of the champions set out to attack the city. Howbeit Laomedon marched against the ships with the multitude and slew Oicles in battle, but being repulsed by the troops of Hercules, he was besieged. The siege once laid, Telamon was the first to breach the wall and enter the city, and after him Hercules. But when he saw that Telamon had entered it first, he drew his sword and rushed at him, loath that anybody should be reputed a better man than himself. Perceiving that, Telamon collected stones that lay to hand, and when Hercules asked him what he did, he said he was building an altar to Hercules the Glorious Victor. Hercules thanked him, and when he had taken the city and shot down Laomedon and his sons, except Podarces, he assigned Laomedon’s daughter Hesione as a prize to Telamon and allowed her to take with her whomsoever of the captives she would. When she chose her brother Podarces, Hercules said that he must first be a slave and then be ransomed by her. So when he was being sold she took the veil from her head and gave it as a ransom; hence Podarces was called Priam.

[1] πλέοντος δὲ ἀπὸ Τροίας Ἡρακλέους Ἥρα χαλεποὺς ἔπεμψε χειμῶνας: ἐφ᾽ οἷς ἀγανακτήσας Ζεὺς ἐκρέμασεν αὐτὴν ἐξ Ὀλύμπου. προσέπλει δὲ Ἡρακλῆς τῇ Κῷ: καὶ νομίσαντες αὐτὸν οἱ Κῷοι λῃστρικὸν ἄγειν στόλον, βάλλοντες λίθοις προσπλεῖν ἐκώλυον. ὁ δὲ βιασάμενος αὐτὴν νυκτὸς εἷλε, καὶ τὸν βασιλέα Εὐρύπυλον, Ἀστυπαλαίας παῖδα καὶ Ποσειδῶνος, ἔκτεινεν. ἐτρώθη δὲ κατὰ τὴν μάχην Ἡρακλῆς ὑπὸ Χαλκώδοντος, καὶ Διὸς ἐξαρπάσαντος αὐτὸν οὐδὲν ἔπαθε. πορθήσας δὲ Κῶ ἧκε δι᾽ Ἀθηνᾶς εἰς Φλέγραν, καὶ μετὰ θεῶν κατεπολέμησε Γίγαντας.

[1] When Hercules was sailing from Troy, Hera sent grievous storms, which so vexed Zeus that he hung her from Olympus. Hercules sailed to Cos, and the Coans, thinking he was leading a piratical squadron, endeavored to prevent his approach by a shower of stones. But he forced his way in and took the city by night, and slew the king, Eurypylus, son of Poseidon by Astypalaea. And Hercules was wounded in the battle by Chalcedon; but Zeus snatched him away, so that he took no harm. And having laid waste Cos, he came through Athena’s agency to Phlegra, and sided with the gods in their victorious war on the giants.

[2] μετ᾽ οὐ πολὺ δὲ ἐπ᾽ Αὐγείαν ἐστρατεύετο, συναθροίσας Ἀρκαδικὸν στρατὸν καὶ παραλαβὼν ἐθελοντὰς τῶν ἀπὸ τῆς Ἑλλάδος ἀριστέων. Αὐγείας δὲ τὸν ἀφ᾽ Ἡρακλέους πόλεμον ἀκούων κατέστησεν Ἠλείων στρατηγοὺς Εὔρυτον καὶ Κτέατον συμφυεῖς, οἳ δυνάμει τοὺς τότε ἀνθρώπους ὑπερέβαλλον, παῖδες δὲ ἦσαν Μολιόνης καὶ Ἄκτορος, ἐλέγοντο δὲ Ποσειδῶνος: Ἄκτωρ δὲ ἀδελφὸς ἦν Αὐγείου. συνέβη δὲ Ἡρακλεῖ κατὰ τὴν στρατείαν νοσῆσαι: διὰ τοῦτο καὶ σπονδὰς πρὸς τοὺς Μολιονίδας ἐποιήσατο. οἱ δὲ ὕστερον ἐπιγνόντες αὐτὸν νοσοῦντα, ἐπιτίθενται τῷ στρατεύματι καὶ κτείνουσι πολλούς. τότε μὲν οὖν ἀνεχώρησεν Ἡρακλῆς: αὖθις δὲ τῆς τρίτης ἰσθμιάδος τελουμένης, Ἠλείων τοὺς Μολιονίδας πεμψάντων συνθύτας, ἐν Κλεωναῖς ἐνεδρεύσας τούτους Ἡρακλῆς ἀπέκτεινε, καὶ στρατευσάμενος ἐπὶ τὴν Ἦλιν εἷλε τὴν πόλιν. καὶ κτείνας μετὰ τῶν παίδων Αὐγείαν κατήγαγε Φυλέα, καὶ τούτῳ τὴν βασιλείαν ἔδωκεν. ἔθηκε δὲ καὶ τὸν Ὀλυμπιακὸν ἀγῶνα, Πέλοπός τε βωμὸν ἱδρύσατο, καὶ θεῶν δώδεκα βωμοὺς ἓξ ἐδείματο.

[2] Not long afterwards he collected an Arcadian army, and being joined by volunteers from the first men in Greece he marched against Augeas. But Augeas, hearing of the war that Hercules was levying, appointed Eurytus and Cteatus generals of the Eleans. They were two men joined in one, who surpassed all of that generation in strength and were sons of Actor by Molione, though their father was said to be Poseidon; now Actor was a brother of Augeas. But it came to pass that on the expedition Hercules fell sick; hence he concluded a truce with the Molionides. But afterwards, being apprized of his illness, they attacked the army and slew many. On that occasion, therefore, Hercules beat a retreat; but afterwards at the celebration of the third Isthmian festival, when the Eleans sent the Molionides to take part in the sacrifices, Hercules waylaid and killed them at Cleonae, and marching on Elis took the city. And having killed Augeas and his sons, he restored Phyleus and bestowed on him the kingdom. He also celebrated the Olympian games and founded an altar of Pelops, and built six altars of the twelve gods.

[3] μετὰ δὲ τὴν τῆς Ἤλιδος ἅλωσιν ἐστράτευσεν ἐπὶ Πύλον, καὶ τὴν πόλιν ἑλὼν Περικλύμενον κτείνει τὸν ἀλκιμώτατον τῶν Νηλέως παίδων, ὃς μεταβάλλων τὰς μορφὰς ἐμάχετο. τὸν δὲ Νηλέα καὶ τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ χωρὶς Νέστορος ἀπέκτεινεν: οὗτος δὲ νέος ὢν παρὰ Γερηνίοις ἐτρέφετο. κατὰ δὲ τὴν μάχην καὶ Ἅιδην ἔτρωσε Πυλίοις βοηθοῦντα.ἑλὼν δὲ τὴν Πύλον ἐστράτευεν ἐπὶ Λακεδαίμονα, μετελθεῖν τοὺς Ἱπποκόωντος παῖδας θέλων: ὠργίζετο μὲν γὰρ αὐτοῖς καὶ διότι Νηλεῖ συνεμάχησαν, μᾶλλον δὲ ὠργίσθη ὅτι τὸν Λικυμνίου παῖδα ἀπέκτειναν. θεωμένου γὰρ αὐτοῦ τὰ Ἱπποκόωντος βασίλεια, ἐκδραμὼν κύων τῶν Μολοττικῶν ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν ἐφέρετο: ὁ δὲ βαλὼν λίθον ἐπέτυχε τοῦ κυνός, ἐκτροχάσαντες δὲ οἱ Ἱπποκοωντίδαι καὶ τύπτοντες αὐτὸν τοῖς σκυτάλοις ἀπέκτειναν. τὸν δὲ τούτου θάνατον ἐκδικῶν στρατιὰν ἐπὶ Λακεδαιμονίους συνήθροιζε. καὶ παραγενόμενος εἰς Ἀρκαδίαν ἠξίου Κηφέα μετὰ τῶν παίδων ὧν εἶχεν εἴκοσι συμμαχεῖν. δεδιὼς δὲ Κηφεὺς μὴ καταλιπόντος αὐτοῦ Τεγέαν Ἀργεῖοι ἐπιστρατεύσωνται, τὴν στρατείαν ἠρνεῖτο. Ἡρακλῆς δὲ παρ᾽ Ἀθηνᾶς λαβὼν ἐν ὑδρίᾳ χαλκῇ βόστρυχον Γοργόνος Στερόπῃ τῇ Κηφέως θυγατρὶ δίδωσιν, εἰπών, ἐὰν ἐπίῃ στρατός, τρὶς ἀνασχούσης ἐκ τῶν τειχῶν τὸν βόστρυχον καὶ μὴ προϊδούσης τροπὴν τῶν πολεμίων ἔσεσθαι. τούτου γενομένου Κηφεὺς μετὰ τῶν παίδων ἐστράτευε. καὶ κατὰ τὴν μάχην αὐτός τε καὶ οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ τελευτῶσι, καὶ πρὸς τούτοις Ἰφικλῆς ὁ τοῦ Ἡρακλέους ἀδελφός. Ἡρακλῆς δὲ κτείνας τὸν Ἱπποκόωντα καὶ τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ καὶ χειρωσάμενος τὴν πόλιν, Τυνδάρεων καταγαγὼν τὴν βασιλείαν παρέδωκε τούτῳ.

[3] After the capture of Elis he marched against Pylus, and having taken the city he slew Periclymenus, the most valiant of the sons of Neleus, who used to change his shape in battle. And he slew Neleus and his sons, except Nestor; for he was a youth and was being brought up among the Gerenians. In the fight he also wounded Hades, who was siding with the Pylians.Having taken Pylus he marched against Lacedaemon, wishing to punish the sons of Hippocoon, for he was angry with them, both because they fought for Neleus, and still angrier because they had killed the son of Licymnius. For when he was looking at the palace of Hippocoon, a hound of the Molossian breed ran out and rushed at him, and he threw a stone and hit the dog, whereupon the Hippocoontids darted out and despatched him with blows of their cudgels. It was to avenge his death that Hercules mustered an army against the Lacedaemonians. And having come to Arcadia he begged Cepheus to join him with his sons, of whom he had twenty. But fearing lest, if he quitted Tegea, the Argives would march against it, Cepheus refused to join the expedition. But Hercules had received from Athena a lock of the Gorgon’s hair in a bronze jar and gave it to Sterope, daughter of Cepheus, saying that if an army advanced against the city, she was to hold up the lock of hair thrice from the walls, and that, provided she did not look before her, the enemy would be turned to flight. That being so, Cepheus and his sons took the field, and in the battle he and his sons perished, and besides them Iphicles, the brother of Hercules. Having killed Hippocoon and his sons and subjugated the city, Hercules restored Tyndareus and entrusted the kingdom to him.

[4] παριὼν δὲ Τεγέαν Ἡρακλῆς τὴν Αὔγην Ἀλεοῦ θυγατέρα οὖσαν ἀγνοῶν ἔφθειρεν. ἡ δὲ τεκοῦσα κρύφα τὸ βρέφος κατέθετο ἐν τῷ τεμένει τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς. λοιμῷ δὲ τῆς χώρας φθειρομένης, Ἀλεὸς εἰσελθὼν εἰς τὸ τέμενος καὶ ἐρευνήσας τὰς τῆς θυγατρὸς ὠδῖνας εὗρε. τὸ μὲν οὖν βρέφος εἰς τὸ Παρθένιον ὄρος ἐξέθετο. καὶ τοῦτο κατὰ θεῶν τινα πρόνοιαν ἐσώθη: θηλὴν μὲν γὰρ ἀρτιτόκος ἔλαφος ὑπέσχεν αὐτῷ, ποιμένες δὲ ἀνελόμενοι τὸ βρέφος Τήλεφον ἐκάλεσαν αὐτό. Αὔγην δὲ ἔδωκε Ναυπλίῳ τῷ Ποσειδῶνος ὑπερόριον ἀπεμπολῆσαι. ὁ δὲ Τεύθραντι τῷ Τευθρανίας ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν δυνάστῃ, κἀκεῖνος γυναῖκα ἐποιήσατο.

[4] Passing by Tegea, Hercules debauched Auge, not knowing her to be a daughter of Aleus. And she brought forth her babe secretly and deposited it in the precinct of Athena. But the country being wasted by a pestilence, Aleus entered the precinct and on investigation discovered his daughter’s motherhood. So he exposed the babe on Mount Parthenius, and by the providence of the gods it was preserved: for a doe that had just cast her fawn gave it suck, and shepherds took up the babe and called it Telephus. And her father gave Auge to Nauplius, son of Poseidon, to sell far away in a foreign land; and Nauplius gave her to Teuthras, the prince of Teuthrania, who made her his wife.

[5] παραγενόμενος δὲ Ἡρακλῆς εἰς Καλυδῶνα τὴν Οἰνέως θυγατέρα Δηιάνειραν ἐμνηστεύετο, καὶ διαπαλαίσας ὑπὲρ τῶν γάμων αὐτῆς πρὸς Ἀχελῷον εἰκασμένον ταύρῳ περιέκλασε τὸ ἕτερον τῶν κεράτων. καὶ τὴν μὲν Δηιάνειραν γαμεῖ, τὸ δὲ κέρας Ἀχελῷος λαμβάνει, δοὺς ἀντὶ τούτου τὸ τῆς Ἀμαλθείας. Ἀμάλθεια δὲ ἦν Αἱμονίου θυγάτηρ, ἣ κέρας εἶχε ταύρου. τοῦτο δέ, ὡς Φερεκύδης λέγει, δύναμιν εἶχε τοιαύτην ὥστε βρωτὸν ἢ ποτόν, ὅπερ ἂν εὔξαιτό τις, παρέχειν ἄφθονον.

[5] And having come to Calydon, Hercules wooed Deianira, daughter of Oeneus. He wrestled for her hand with Achelous, who assumed the likeness of a bull; but Hercules broke off one of his horns. So Hercules married Deianira, but Achelous recovered the horn by giving the horn of Amalthea in its stead. Now Amalthea was a daughter of Haemonius, and she had a bull’s horn, which, according to Pherecydes, had the power of supplying meat or drink in abundance, whatever one might wish.

[6] στρατεύει δὲ Ἡρακλῆς μετὰ Καλυδωνίων ἐπὶ Θεσπρωτούς, καὶ πόλιν ἑλὼν Ἔφυραν, ἧς ἐβασίλευε Φύλας, Ἀστυόχῃ τῇ τούτου θυγατρὶ συνελθὼν πατὴρ Τληπολέμου γίνεται. διατελῶν δὲ παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς, πέμψας πρὸς Θέσπιον ἑπτὰ μὲν κατέχειν ἔλεγε παῖδας, τρεῖς δὲ εἰς Θήβας ἀποστέλλειν, τοὺς δὲ λοιποὺς τεσσαράκοντα πέμπειν εἰς Σαρδὼ τὴν νῆσον ἐπ᾽ ἀποικίαν. γενομένων δὲ τούτων εὐωχούμενος παρ᾽ Οἰνεῖ κονδύλῳ πλήξας ἀπέκτεινεν Ἀρχιτέλους παῖδα Εὔνομον κατὰ χειρῶν διδόντα: συγγενὴς δὲ Οἰνέως οὗτος. ἀλλ᾽ ὁ μὲν πατὴρ τοῦ παιδός, ἀκουσίως γεγενημένου τοῦ συμβεβηκότος, συνεγνωμόνει, Ἡρακλῆς δὲ κατὰ τὸν νόμον τὴν φυγὴν ὑπομένειν ἤθελε, καὶ διέγνω πρὸς Κήυκα εἰς Τραχῖνα ἀπιέναι. ἄγων δὲ Δηιάνειραν ἐπὶ ποταμὸν Εὔηνον ἧκεν, ἐν ᾧ καθεζόμενος Νέσσος ὁ Κένταυρος τοὺς παριόντας διεπόρθμευε μισθοῦ, λέγων παρὰ θεῶν τὴν πορθμείαν εἰληφέναι διὰ δικαιοσύνην. αὐτὸς μὲν οὖν Ἡρακλῆς τὸν ποταμὸν διέβη, Δηιάνειραν δὲ μισθὸν αἰτηθεὶς ἐπέτρεψε Νέσσῳ διακομίζειν. ὁ δὲ διαπορθμεύων αὐτὴν ἐπεχείρει βιάζεσθαι. τῆς δὲ ἀνακραγούσης αἰσθόμενος Ἡρακλῆς ἐξελθόντα Νέσσον ἐτόξευσεν εἰς τὴν καρδίαν. ὁ δὲ μέλλων τελευτᾶν προσκαλεσάμενος Δηιάνειραν εἶπεν, εἰ θέλοι φίλτρον πρὸς Ἡρακλέα ἔχειν, τόν τε γόνον ὃν ἀφῆκε κατὰ τῆς γῆς καὶ τὸ ῥυὲν ἐκ τοῦ τραύματος τῆς ἀκίδος αἷμα συμμῖξαι, ἡ δὲ ποιήσασα τοῦτο ἐφύλαττε παρ᾽ ἑαυτῇ.

[6] And Hercules marched with the Calydonians against the Thesprotians, and having taken the city of Ephyra, of which Phylas was king, he had intercourse with the king’s daughter Astyoche, and became the father of Tlepolemus. While he stayed among them, he sent word to Thespius to keep seven of his sons, to send three to Thebes and to despatch the remaining forty to the island of Sardinia to plant a colony. After these events, as he was feasting with Oeneus, he killed with a blow of his knuckles endeavored, son of Architeles, when the lad was pouring water on his hands; now the lad was a kinsman of Oeneus. Seeing that it was an accident, the lad’s father pardoned Hercules; but Hercules wished, in accordance with the law, to suffer the penalty of exile, and resolved to depart to Ceyx at Trachis. And taking Deianira with him, he came to the river Evenus, at which the centaur Nessus sat and ferried passengers across for hire, alleging that he had received the ferry from the gods for his righteousness. So Hercules crossed the river by himself, but on being asked to pay the fare he entrusted Deianira to Nessus to carry over. But he, in ferrying her across, attempted to violate her. She cried out, Hercules heard her, and shot Nessus to the heart when he emerged from the river. Being at the point of death, Nessus called Deianira to him and said that if she would have a love charm to operate on Hercules she should mix the seed he had dropped on the ground with the blood that flowed from the wound inflicted by the barb. She did so and kept it by her.

[7] διεξιὼν δὲ Ἡρακλῆς τὴν Δρυόπων χώραν, ἀπορῶν τροφῆς, ἀπαντήσαντος Θειοδάμαντος βοηλατοῦντος τὸν ἕτερον τῶν ταύρων λύσας καὶ σφάξας εὐωχήσατο. ὡς δὲ ἦλθεν εἰς Τραχῖνα πρὸς Κήυκα, ὑποδεχθεὶς ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ Δρύοπας κατεπολέμησεν.αὖθις δὲ ἐκεῖθεν ὁρμηθεὶς Αἰγιμίῳ βασιλεῖ Δωριέων συνεμάχησε: Λαπίθαι γὰρ περὶ γῆς ὅρων ἐπολέμουν αὐτῷ Κορώνου στρατηγοῦντος, ὁ δὲ πολιορκούμενος ἐπεκαλέσατο τὸν Ἡρακλέα βοηθὸν ἐπὶ μέρει τῆς γῆς. βοηθήσας δὲ Ἡρακλῆς ἀπέκτεινε Κόρωνον μετὰ καὶ ἄλλων, καὶ τὴν γῆν ἅπασαν παρέδωκεν ἐλευθέραν αὐτῷ. ἀπέκτεινε δὲ καὶ Λαογόραν μετὰ τῶν τέκνων, βασιλέα Δρυόπων, ἐν Ἀπόλλωνος τεμένει δαινύμενον, ὑβριστὴν ὄντα καὶ Λαπιθῶν σύμμαχον. παριόντα δὲ Ἴτωνον εἰς μονομαχίαν προεκαλέσατο αὐτὸν Κύκνος Ἄρεος καὶ Πελοπίας: συστὰς δὲ καὶ τοῦτον ἀπέκτεινεν. ὡς δὲ εἰς Ὀρμένιον ἧκεν, Ἀμύντωρ αὐτὸν ὁ βασιλεὺς μεθ᾽ ὅπλων οὐκ εἴα διέρχεσθαι: κωλυόμενος δὲ παριέναι καὶ τοῦτον ἀπέκτεινεν.ἀφικόμενος δὲ εἰς Τραχῖνα στρατιὰν ἐπ᾽ Οἰχαλίαν συνήθροισεν, Εὔρυτον τιμωρήσασθαι θέλων. συμμαχούντων δὲ αὐτῷ Ἀρκάδων καὶ Μηλιέων τῶν ἐκ Τραχῖνος καὶ Λοκρῶν τῶν Ἐπικνημιδίων, κτείνας μετὰ τῶν παίδων Εὔρυτον αἱρεῖ τὴν πόλιν. καὶ θάψας τῶν σὺν αὐτῷ στρατευσαμένων τοὺς ἀποθανόντας, Ἵππασόν τε τὸν Κήυκος καὶ Ἀργεῖον καὶ Μέλανα τοὺς Λικυμνίου παῖδας, καὶ λαφυραγωγήσας τὴν πόλιν, ἦγεν Ἰόλην αἰχμάλωτον. καὶ προσορμισθεὶς Κηναίῳ τῆς Εὐβοίας ἀκρωτηρίῳ Διὸς Κηναίου βωμὸν ἱδρύσατο. μέλλων δὲ ἱερουργεῖν εἰς Τραχῖνα Λίχαν τὸν κήρυκα ἔπεμψε λαμπρὰν ἐσθῆτα οἴσοντα. παρὰ δὲ τούτου τὰ περὶ τὴν Ἰόλην Δηιάνειρα πυθομένη, καὶ δείσασα μὴ ἐκείνην μᾶλλον ἀγαπήσῃ, νομίσασα ταῖς ἀληθείαις φίλτρον εἶναι τὸ ῥυὲν αἷμα Νέσσου, τούτῳ τὸν χιτῶνα ἔχρισεν. ἐνδὺς δὲ Ἡρακλῆς ἔθυεν. ὡς δὲ θερμανθέντος τοῦ χιτῶνος ὁ τῆς ὕδρας ἰὸς τὸν χρῶτα ἔσηπε, τὸν μὲν Λίχαν τῶν ποδῶν ἀράμενος κατηκόντισεν ἀπὸ τῆς †Βοιωτίας, τὸν δὲ χιτῶνα ἀπέσπα προσπεφυκότα τῷ σώματι: συναπεσπῶντο δὲ καὶ αἱ σάρκες αὐτοῦ. τοιαύτῃ συμφορᾷ κατασχεθεὶς εἰς Τραχῖνα ἐπὶ νεὼς κομίζεται. Δηιάνειρα δὲ αἰσθομένη τὸ γεγονὸς ἑαυτὴν ἀνήρτησεν. Ἡρακλῆς δὲ ἐντειλάμενος Ὕλλῳ, ὃς ἐκ Δηιανείρας ἦν αὐτῷ παῖς πρεσβύτερος, Ἰόλην ἀνδρωθέντα γῆμαι, παραγενόμενος εἰς Οἴτην ὄρος （ἔστι δὲ τοῦτο Τραχινίων）, ἐκεῖ πυρὰν ποιήσας ἐκέλευσεν ἐπιβὰς ὑφάπτειν. μηδενὸς δὲ τοῦτο πράττειν ἐθέλοντος, Ποίας παριὼν κατὰ ζήτησιν ποιμνίων ὑφῆψε. τούτῳ καὶ τὰ τόξα ἐδωρήσατο Ἡρακλῆς. καιομένης δὲ τῆς πυρᾶς λέγεται νέφος ὑποστὰν μετὰ βροντῆς αὐτὸν εἰς οὐρανὸν ἀναπέμψαι. ἐκεῖθεν δὲ τυχὼν ἀθανασίας καὶ διαλλαγεὶς Ἥρᾳ τὴν ἐκείνης θυγατέρα Ἥβην ἔγημεν, ἐξ ἧς αὐτῷ παῖδες Ἀλεξιάρης καὶ Ἀνίκητος ἐγένοντο.

[7] Going through the country of the Dryopes and being in lack of food, Hercules met Thiodamas driving a pair of bullocks; so he unloosed and slaughtered one of the bullocks and feasted. And when he came to Ceyx at Trachis he was received by him and conquered the Dryopes.And afterwards setting out from there, he fought as an ally of Aegimius, king of the Dorians. For the Lapiths, commanded by Coronus, made war on him in a dispute about the boundaries of the country; and being besieged he called in the help of Hercules, offering him a share of the country. So Hercules came to his help and slew Coronus and others, and handed the whole country over to Aegimius free. He slew also Laogoras, king of the Dryopes, with his children, as he was banqueting in a precinct of Apollo; for the king was a wanton fellow and an ally of the Lapiths. And as he passed by Itonus he was challenged to single combat by Cycnus a son of Ares and Pelopia; and closing with him Hercules slew him also. But when he was come to Ormenium, king Amyntor took arms and forbade him to march through; but when he would have hindered his passage, Hercules slew him also.On his arrival at Trachis he mustered an army to attack Oechalia, wishing to punish Eurytus. Being joined by Arcadians, Melians from Trachis, and Epicnemidian Locrians, he slew Eurytus and his sons and took the city. After burying those of his own side who had fallen, to wit, Hippasus, son of Ceyx, and Argius and Melas, the sons of Licymnius, he pillaged the city and led Iole captive. And having put in at Cenaeum, a headland of Euboea, he built an altar of Cenaean Zeus. Intending to offer sacrifice, he sent the herald Lichas to Trachis to fetch fine raiment. From him Deianira learned about Iole, and fearing that Hercules might love that damsel more than herself, she supposed that the spilt blood of Nessus was in truth a love-charm, and with it she smeared the tunic. So Hercules put it on and proceeded to offer sacrifice. But no sooner was the tunic warmed than the poison of the hydra began to corrode his skin; and on that he lifted Lichas by the feet, hurled him down from the headland, and tore off the tunic, which clung to his body, so that his flesh was torn away with it. In such a sad plight he was carried on shipboard to Trachis: and Deianira, on learning what had happened, hanged herself. But Hercules, after charging Hyllus his elder son by Deianira, to marry Iole when he came of age, proceeded to Mount Oeta, in the Trachinian territory, and there constructed a pyre, mounted it, and gave orders to kindle it. When no one would do so, Poeas, passing by to look for his flocks, set a light to it. On him Hercules bestowed his bow. While the pyre was burning, it is said that a cloud passed under Hercules and with a peal of thunder wafted him up to heaven. Thereafter he obtained immortality, and being reconciled to Hera he married her daughter Hebe, by whom he had sons, Alexiares and Anicetus.

[1] μεταστάντος δὲ Ἡρακλέους εἰς θεοὺς οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ φυγόντες Εὐρυσθέα πρὸς Κήυκα παρεγένοντο. ὡς δὲ ἐκείνους ἐκδιδόναι λέγοντος Εὐρυσθέως καὶ πόλεμον ἀπειλοῦντος ἐδεδοίκεσαν, Τραχῖνα καταλιπόντες διὰ τῆς Ἑλλάδος ἔφυγον. διωκόμενοι δὲ ἦλθον εἰς Ἀθήνας, καὶ καθεσθέντες ἐπὶ τὸν ἐλέου βωμὸν ἠξίουν βοηθεῖσθαι. Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ οὐκ ἐκδιδόντες αὐτοὺς πρὸς τὸν Εὐρυσθέα πόλεμον ὑπέστησαν, καὶ τοὺς μὲν παῖδας αὐτοῦ Ἀλέξανδρον Ἰφιμέδοντα Εὐρύβιον Μέντορα Περιμήδην ἀπέκτειναν: αὐτὸν δὲ Εὐρυσθέα φεύγοντα ἐφ᾽ ἅρματος καὶ πέτρας ἤδη παριππεύοντα Σκειρωνίδας κτείνει διώξας Ὕλλος, καὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν ἀποτεμὼν Ἀλκμήνῃ δίδωσιν: ἡ δὲ κερκίσι τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ἐξώρυξεν αὐτοῦ.

[1] When Hercules had been translated to the gods, his sons fled from Eurystheus and came to Ceyx. But when Eurystheus demanded their surrender and threatened war, they were afraid, and, quitting Trachis, fled through Greece. Being pursued, they came to Athens, and sitting down on the altar of Mercy, claimed protection. Refusing to surrender them, the Athenians bore the brunt of war with Eurystheus, and slew his sons, Alexander, Iphimedon, Eurybius, Mentor and Perimedes. Eurystheus himself fled in a chariot, but was pursued and slain by Hyllus just as he was driving past the Scironian cliffs; and Hyllus cut off his head and gave it to Alcmena; and she gouged out his eyes with weaving-pins.

[2] ἀπολομένου δὲ Εὐρυσθέως ἐπὶ Πελοπόννησον ἦλθον οἱ Ἡρακλεῖδαι, καὶ πάσας εἷλον τὰς πόλεις. ἐνιαυτοῦ δὲ αὐτοῖς ἐν τῇ καθόδῳ διαγενομένου φθορὰ πᾶσαν Πελοπόννησον κατέσχε, καὶ ταύτην γενέσθαι χρησμὸς διὰ τοὺς Ἡρακλείδας ἐδήλου: πρὸ γὰρ τοῦ δέοντος αὐτοὺς κατελθεῖν. ὅθεν ἀπολιπόντες Πελοπόννησον ἀνεχώρησαν εἰς Μαραθῶνα κἀκεῖ κατῴκουν. Τληπόλεμος οὖν κτείνας οὐχ ἑκὼν Λικύμνιον （τῇ βακτηρίᾳ γὰρ αὐτοῦ θεράποντα πλήσσοντος ὑπέδραμε） πρὶν ἐξελθεῖν αὐτοὺς ἐκ Πελοποννήσου, φεύγων μετ᾽ οὐκ ὀλίγων ἧκεν εἰς Ῥόδον, κἀκεῖ κατῴκει.

[2] After Eurystheus had perished, the Heraclids came to attack Peloponnese and they captured all the cities. When a year had elapsed from their return, a plague visited the whole of Peloponnese; and an oracle declared that this happened on account of the Heraclids, because they had returned before the proper time. Hence they quitted Peloponnese and retired to Marathon and dwelt there. Now before they came out of Peloponnese, Tlepolemus had killed Licymnius inadvertently; for while he was beating a servant with his stick Licymnius ran in between; so he fled with not a few, and came to Rhodes, and dwelt there. But Hyllus married Iole according to his father’s commands, and sought to effect the return of the Heraclids. So he went to Delphi and inquired how they should return; and the god said that they should await the third crop before returning. But Hyllus supposed that the third crop signified three years; and having waited that time he returned with his army ... of Hercules to Peloponnese, when Tisamenus, son of Orestes, was reigning over the Peloponnesians. And in another battle the Peloponnesians were victorious, and Aristomachus was slain. But when the sons of Cleodaeus were grown to man’s estate, they inquired of the oracle concerning their return. And the god having given the same answer as before, Temenus blamed him, saying that when they had obeyed the oracle they had been unfortunate. But the god retorted that they were themselves to blame for their misfortunes, for they did not understand the oracles, seeing that by “ the third crop” he meant, not a crop of the earth, but a crop of a generation, and that by the narrows he meant the broad-bellied sea on the right of the Isthmus. On hearing that, Temenus made ready the army and built ships in Locris where the place is now named Naupactus from that. While the army was there, Aristodemus was killed by a thunderbolt, leaving twin sons, Eurysthenes and Procles, by Argia, daughter of Autesion.

[3] συνέβη δὲ καὶ τὸν στρατὸν ἐν Ναυπάκτῳ συμφορᾷ περιπεσεῖν. ἐφάνη γὰρ αὐτοῖς μάντις χρησμοὺς λέγων καὶ ἐνθεάζων, ὃν ἐνόμισαν μάγον εἶναι ἐπὶ λύμῃ τοῦ στρατοῦ πρὸς Πελοποννησίων ἀπεσταλμένον. τοῦτον βαλὼν ἀκοντίῳ Ἱππότης ὁ Φύλαντος τοῦ Ἀντιόχου τοῦ Ἡρακλέους τυχὼν ἀπέκτεινεν. οὕτως δὲ γενομένου τούτου τὸ μὲν ναυτικὸν διαφθαρεισῶν τῶν νεῶν ἀπώλετο, τὸ δὲ πεζὸν ἠτύχησε λιμῷ, καὶ διελύθη τὸ στράτευμα. χρωμένου δὲ περὶ τῆς συμφορᾶς Τημένου, καὶ τοῦ θεοῦ διὰ τοῦ μάντεως γενέσθαι ταῦτα λέγοντος, καὶ κελεύοντος φυγαδεῦσαι δέκα ἔτη τὸν ἀνελόντα καὶ χρήσασθαι ἡγεμόνι τῷ τριοφθάλμῳ, τὸν μὲν Ἱππότην ἐφυγάδευσαν, τὸν δὲ τριόφθαλμον ἐζήτουν. καὶ περιτυγχάνουσιν Ὀξύλῳ τῷ Ἀνδραίμονος, ἐφ᾽ ἵππου καθημένῳ μονοφθάλμου （τὸν γὰρ ἕτερον τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν ἐκκέκοπτο τόξῳ）. ἐπὶ φόνῳ γὰρ οὗτος φυγὼν εἰς Ἦλιν, ἐκεῖθεν εἰς Αἰτωλίαν ἐνιαυτοῦ διελθόντος ἐπανήρχετο. συμβαλόντες οὖν τὸν χρησμόν, τοῦτον ἡγεμόνα ποιοῦνται. καὶ συμβαλόντες τοῖς πολεμίοις καὶ τῷ πεζῷ καὶ τῷ ναυτικῷ προτεροῦσι στρατῷ, καὶ Τισαμενὸν κτείνουσι τὸν Ὀρέστου. θνήσκουσι δὲ συμμαχοῦντες αὐτοῖς οἱ Αἰγιμίου παῖδες, Πάμφυλος καὶ Δύμας.

[3] And it chanced that a calamity also befell the army at Naupactus. For there appeared to them a soothsayer reciting oracles in a fine frenzy, whom they took for a magician sent by the Peloponnesians to be the ruin of the army. So Hippotes, son of Phylas, son of Antiochus, son of Hercules, threw a javelin at him, and hit and killed him. In consequence of that, the naval force perished with the destruction of the fleet, and the land force suffered from famine, and the army disbanded. When Temenus inquired of the oracle concerning this calamity, the god said that these things were done by the soothsayer and he ordered him to banish the slayer for ten years and to take for his guide the Three-Eyed One. So they banished Hippotes, and sought for the Three-Eyed One. And they chanced to light on Oxylus, son of Andraemon, a man sitting on a one-eyed horse （ its other eye having been knocked out with an arrow）; for he had fled to Elis on account of a murder, and was now returning from there to Aetolia after the lapse of a year. So guessing the purport of the oracle, they made him their guide. And having engaged the enemy they got the better of him both by land and sea, and slew Tisamenus, son of Orestes. Their allies, Pamphylus and Dymas, the sons of Aegimius, also fell in the fight.

[4] ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἐκράτησαν Πελοποννήσου, τρεῖς ἱδρύσαντο βωμοὺς πατρῴου Διός, καὶ ἐπὶ τούτων ἔθυσαν, καὶ ἐκληροῦντο τὰς πόλεις. πρώτη μὲν οὖν λῆξις Ἄργος, δευτέρα δὲ Λακεδαίμων, τρίτη δὲ Μεσσήνη. κομισάντων δὲ ὑδρίαν ὕδατος, ἔδοξε ψῆφον βαλεῖν ἕκαστον. Τήμενος οὖν καὶ οἱ Ἀριστοδήμου παῖδες Προκλῆς καὶ Εὐρυσθένης ἔβαλον λίθους, Κρεσφόντης δὲ βουλόμενος Μεσσήνην λαχεῖν γῆς ἐνέβαλε βῶλον. ταύτης δὲ διαλυθείσης ἔδει τοὺς δύο κλήρους ἀναφανῆναι. ἑλκυσθείσης δὲ πρώτης μὲν τῆς Τημένου, δευτέρας δὲ τῆς τῶν Ἀριστοδήμου παίδων, Μεσσήνην ἔλαβε Κρεσφόντης.

[4] When they had made themselves masters of Peloponnese, they set up three altars of Paternal Zeus, and sacrificed upon them, and cast lots for the cities. So the first drawing was for Argos, the second for Lacedaemon, and the third for Messene. And they brought a pitcher of water, and resolved that each should cast in a lot. Now Temenus and the two sons of Aristodemus, Procles and Eurysthenes, threw stones; but Cresphontes, wishing to have Messene allotted to him, threw in a clod of earth. As the clod was dissolved in the water, it could not be but that the other two lots should turn up. The lot of Temenus having been drawn first, and that of the sons of Aristodemus second, Cresphontes got Messene.

[5] ἐπὶ δὲ τοῖς βωμοῖς οἷς ἔθυσαν εὗρον σημεῖα κείμενα οἱ μὲν λαχόντες Ἄργος φρῦνον, οἱ δὲ Λακεδαίμονα δράκοντα, οἱ δὲ Μεσσήνην ἀλώπεκα. περὶ δὲ τῶν σημείων ἔλεγον οἱ μάντεις, τοῖς μὲν τὸν φρῦνον καταλαβοῦσιν ἐπὶ τῆς πόλεως μένειν ἄμεινον （μὴ γὰρ ἔχειν ἀλκὴν πορευόμενον τὸ θηρίον）, τοὺς δὲ δράκοντα καταλαβόντας δεινοὺς ἐπιόντας ἔλεγον ἔσεσθαι, τοὺς δὲ τὴν ἀλώπεκα δολίους.Τήμενος μὲν οὖν παραπεμπόμενος τοὺς παῖδας Ἀγέλαον καὶ Εὐρύπυλον καὶ Καλλίαν, τῇ θυγατρὶ προσανεῖχεν Ὑρνηθοῖ καὶ τῷ ταύτης ἀνδρὶ Δηιφόντῃ. ὅθεν οἱ παῖδες πείθουσί τινας ἐπὶ μισθῷ τὸν πατέρα αὐτῶν φονεῦσαι. γενομένου δὲ τοῦ φόνου τὴν βασιλείαν ὁ στρατὸς ἔχειν ἐδικαίωσεν Ὑρνηθὼ καὶ Δηιφόντην. Κρεσφόντης δὲ οὐ πολὺν Μεσσήνης βασιλεύσας χρόνον μετὰ δύο παίδων φονευθεὶς ἀπέθανε. Πολυφόντης δὲ ἐβασίλευσεν, αὐτῶν τῶν Ἡρακλειδῶν ὑπάρχων, καὶ τὴν τοῦ φονευθέντος γυναῖκα Μερόπην ἄκουσαν ἔλαβεν. ἀνῃρέθη δὲ καὶ οὗτος. τρίτον γὰρ ἔχουσα παῖδα Μερόπη καλούμενον Αἴπυτον ἔδωκε τῷ ἑαυτῆς πατρὶ τρέφειν. οὗτος ἀνδρωθεὶς καὶ κρύφα κατελθὼν ἔκτεινε Πολυφόντην καὶ τὴν πατρῴαν βασιλείαν ἀπέλαβεν.

[5] And on the altars on which they sacrificed they found signs lying: for they who got Argos by the lot found a toad; those who got Lacedaemon found a serpent; and those who got Messene found a fox. As to these signs the seers said that those who found the toad had better stay in the city （ seeing that the animal has no strength when it walks）; that those who found the serpent would be terrible in attack, and that those who found the fox would be wily.Now Temenus, passing over his sons Agelaus, Eurypylus, and Callias, favoured his daughter Hyrnetho and her husband Deiphontes; hence his sons hired some fellows to murder their father. On the perpetration of the murder the army decided that the kingdom belonged to Hyrnetho and Deiphontes. Cresphontes had not long reigned over Messene when he was murdered with two of his sons; and Polyphontes, one of the true Heraclids, came to the throne and took to wife, against her will, Merope, the wife of the murdered man. But he too was slain. For Merope had a third son, called Aepytus, whom she gave to her own father to bring up. When he was come to manhood he secretly returned, killed Polyphontes, and recovered the kingdom of his fathers.

## Βιβλίο Γ

[1] ἐπεὶ δὲ τὸ Ἰνάχειον διερχόμενοι γένος τοὺς ἀπὸ Βήλου μέχρι τῶν Ἡρακλειδῶν δεδηλώκαμεν, ἐχομένως λέγωμεν καὶ τὰ περὶ Ἀγήνορος. ὡς γὰρ ἡμῖν λέλεκται, δύο Λιβύη ἐγέννησε παῖδας ἐκ Ποσειδῶνος, Βῆλον καὶ Ἀγήνορα. Βῆλος μὲν οὖν βασιλεύων Αἰγυπτίων τοὺς προειρημένους ἐγέννησεν, Ἀγήνωρ δὲ παραγενόμενος εἰς τὴν Φοινίκην γαμεῖ Τηλέφασσαν καὶ τεκνοῖ θυγατέρα μὲν Εὐρώπην, παῖδας δὲ Κάδμον καὶ Φοίνικα καὶ Κίλικα. τινὲς δὲ Εὐρώπην οὐκ Ἀγήνορος ἀλλὰ Φοίνικος λέγουσι. ταύτης Ζεὺς ἐρασθείς, †ῥόδου ἀποπλέων, ταῦρος χειροήθης γενόμενος, ἐπιβιβασθεῖσαν διὰ τῆς θαλάσσης ἐκόμισεν εἰς Κρήτην. ἡ δέ, ἐκεῖ συνευνασθέντος αὐτῇ Διός, ἐγέννησε Μίνωα Σαρπηδόνα Ῥαδάμανθυν: καθ᾽ Ὅμηρον δὲ Σαρπηδὼν ἐκ Διὸς καὶ Λαοδαμείας τῆς Βελλεροφόντου. ἀφανοῦς δὲ Εὐρώπης γενομένης ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῆς Ἀγήνωρ ἐπὶ ζήτησιν ἐξέπεμψε τοὺς παῖδας, εἰπὼν μὴ πρότερον ἀναστρέφειν πρὶν ἂν ἐξεύρωσιν Εὐρώπην. συνεξῆλθε δὲ ἐπὶ τὴν ζήτησιν αὐτῆς Τηλέφασσα ἡ μήτηρ καὶ Θάσος ὁ Ποσειδῶνος, ὡς δὲ Φερεκύδης φησὶ Κίλικος. ὡς δὲ πᾶσαν ποιούμενοι ζήτησιν εὑρεῖν ἦσαν Εὐρώπην ἀδύνατοι, τὴν εἰς οἶκον ἀνακομιδὴν ἀπογνόντες ἄλλος ἀλλαχοῦ κατῴκησαν, Φοῖνιξ μὲν ἐν Φοινίκῃ, Κίλιξ δὲ Φοινίκης πλησίον, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν ὑφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ κειμένην χώραν ποταμῷ σύνεγγυς Πυράμῳ Κιλικίαν ἐκάλεσε: Κάδμος δὲ καὶ Τηλέφασσα ἐν Θρᾴκῃ κατῴκησαν. ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ Θάσος ἐν Θρᾴκῃ κτίσας πόλιν Θάσον κατῴκησεν.

[1] Having now run over the family of Inachus and described them from Belus down to the Heraclids, we have next to speak of the house of Agenor. For as I have said, Libya had by Poseidon two sons, Belus and Agenor. Now Belus reigned over the Egyptians and begat the aforesaid sons; but Agenor went to Phoenicia, married Telephassa, and begat a daughter Europa and three sons, Cadmus, Phoenix, and Cilix. But some say that Europa was a daughter not of Agenor but of Phoenix. Zeus loved her, and turning himself into a tame bull, he mounted her on his back and conveyed her through the sea to Crete. There Zeus bedded with her, and she bore Minos, Sarpedon, and Rhadamanthys; but according to Homer, Sarpedon was a son of Zeus by Laodamia, daughter of Bellerophon. On the disappearance of Europa her father Agenor sent out his sons in search of her, telling them not to return until they had found Europa. With them her mother, Telephassa, and Thasus, son of Poseidon, or according to Pherecydes, of Cilix, went forth in search of her. But when, after diligent search, they could not find Europa, they gave up the thought of returning home, and took up their abode in divers places; Phoenix settled in Phoenicia; Cilix settled near Phoenicia, and all the country subject to himself near the river Pyramus he called Cilicia; and Cadmus and Telephassa took up their abode in Thrace and in like manner Thasus founded a city Thasus in an island off Thrace and dwelt there.

[2] Εὐρώπην δὲ γήμας Ἀστέριος ὁ Κρητῶν δυνάστης τοὺς ἐκ ταύτης παῖδας ἔτρεφεν. οἱ δὲ ὡς ἐτελειώθησαν, πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἐστασίασαν: ἴσχουσι γὰρ ἔρωτα παιδὸς ὃς ἐκαλεῖτο Μίλητος, Ἀπόλλωνος δὲ ἦν καὶ Ἀρείας τῆς Κλεόχου. τοῦ δὲ παιδὸς πρὸς Σαρπηδόνα μᾶλλον οἰκείως ἔχοντος πολεμήσας Μίνως ἐπροτέρησεν. οἱ δὲ φεύγουσι, καὶ Μίλητος μὲν Καρίᾳ προσσχὼν ἐκεῖ πόλιν ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ ἔκτισε Μίλητον, Σαρπηδὼν δὲ συμμαχήσας Κίλικι πρὸς Λυκίους ἔχοντι πόλεμον, ἐπὶ μέρει τῆς χώρας, Λυκίας ἐβασίλευσε. καὶ αὐτῷ δίδωσι Ζεὺς ἐπὶ τρεῖς γενεὰς ζῆν. ἔνιοι δὲ αὐτοὺς ἐρασθῆναι λέγουσιν Ἀτυμνίου τοῦ Διὸς καὶ Κασσιεπείας, καὶ διὰ τοῦτον στασιάσαι. Ῥαδάμανθυς δὲ τοῖς νησιώταις νομοθετῶν, αὖθις φυγὼν εἰς Βοιωτίαν Ἀλκμήνην γαμεῖ, καὶ μεταλλάξας ἐν Ἅιδου μετὰ Μίνωος δικάζει. Μίνως δὲ Κρήτην κατοικῶν ἔγραψε νόμους, καὶ γήμας Πασιφάην τὴν Ἡλίου καὶ Περσηίδος, ὡς δὲ Ἀσκληπιάδης φησί, Κρήτην τὴν Ἀστερίου θυγατέρα, παῖδας μὲν ἐτέκνωσε Κατρέα Δευκαλίωνα Γλαῦκον Ἀνδρόγεων, θυγατέρας δὲ Ἀκάλλην Ξενοδίκην Ἀριάδνην Φαίδραν, ἐκ Παρείας δὲ νύμφης Εὐρυμέδοντα Νηφαλίωνα Χούσην Φιλόλαον, ἐκ δὲ Δεξιθέας Εὐξάνθιον.

[2] Now Asterius, prince of the Cretans, married Europa and brought up her children. But when they were grown up, they quarrelled with each other; for they loved a boy called Miletus, son of Apollo by Aria, daughter of Cleochus. As the boy was more friendly to Sarpedon, Minos went to war and had the better of it, and the others fled. Miletus landed in Caria and there founded a city which he called Miletus after himself; and Sarpedon allied himself with Cilix, who was at war with the Lycians, and having stipulated for a share of the country, he became king of Lycia. And Zeus granted him to live for three generations. But some say that they loved Atymnius, the son of Zeus and Cassiepea, and that it was about him that they quarrelled. Rhadamanthys legislated for the islanders but afterwards he fled to Boeotia and married Alcmena; and since his departure from the world he acts as judge in Hades along with Minos. Minos, residing in Crete, passed laws, and married Pasiphae, daughter of the Sun and Perseis; but Asclepiades says that his wife was Crete, daughter of Asterius. He begat sons, to wit, Catreus, Deucalion, Glaucus, and Androgeus: and daughters, to wit, Acalle, Xenodice, Ariadne, Phaedra; and by a nymph Paria he had Eurymedon, Nephalion, Chryses, and Philolaus; and by Dexithea he had Euxanthius.

[3] Ἀστερίου δὲ ἄπαιδος ἀποθανόντος Μίνως βασιλεύειν θέλων Κρήτης ἐκωλύετο. φήσας δὲ παρὰ θεῶν τὴν βασιλείαν εἰληφέναι, τοῦ πιστευθῆναι χάριν ἔφη, ὅ τι ἂν εὔξηται, γενέσθαι. καὶ Ποσειδῶνι θύων ηὔξατο ταῦρον ἀναφανῆναι ἐκ τῶν βυθῶν, καταθύσειν ὑποσχόμενος τὸν φανέντα. τοῦ δὲ Ποσειδῶνος ταῦρον ἀνέντος αὐτῷ διαπρεπῆ τὴν βασιλείαν παρέλαβε, τὸν δὲ ταῦρον εἰς τὰ βουκόλια πέμψας ἔθυσεν ἕτερον. θαλασσοκρατήσας δὲ πρῶτος πασῶν τῶν νήσων σχεδὸν ἐπῆρξεν.

[3] Asterius dying childless, Minos wished to reign over Crete, but his claim was opposed. So he alleged that he had received the kingdom from the gods, and in proof of it he said that whatever he prayed for would be done. And in sacrificing to Poseidon he prayed that a bull might appear from the depths, promising to sacrifice it when it appeared. Poseidon did send him up a fine bull, and Minos obtained the kingdom, but he sent the bull to the herds and sacrificed another. [ Being the first to obtain the dominion of the sea, he extended his rule over almost all the islands. ]

[4] ὀργισθεὶς δὲ αὐτῷ Ποσειδῶν ὅτι μὴ κατέθυσε τὸν ταῦρον, τοῦτον μὲν ἐξηγρίωσε, Πασιφάην δὲ ἐλθεῖν εἰς ἐπιθυμίαν αὐτοῦ παρεσκεύασεν. ἡ δὲ ἐρασθεῖσα τοῦ ταύρου συνεργὸν λαμβάνει Δαίδαλον, ὃς ἦν ἀρχιτέκτων, πεφευγὼς ἐξ Ἀθηνῶν ἐπὶ φόνῳ. οὗτος ξυλίνην βοῦν ἐπὶ τροχῶν κατασκευάσας, καὶ ταύτην λαβὼν καὶ κοιλάνας ἔνδοθεν, ἐκδείρας τε βοῦν τὴν δορὰν περιέρραψε, καὶ θεὶς ἐν ᾧπερ εἴθιστο ὁ ταῦρος λειμῶνι βόσκεσθαι, τὴν Πασιφάην ἐνεβίβασεν. ἐλθὼν δὲ ὁ ταῦρος ὡς ἀληθινῇ βοῒ συνῆλθεν. ἡ δὲ Ἀστέριον ἐγέννησε τὸν κληθέντα Μινώταυρον. οὗτος εἶχε ταύρου πρόσωπον, τὰ δὲ λοιπὰ ἀνδρός: Μίνως δὲ ἐν τῷ λαβυρίνθῳ κατά τινας χρησμοὺς κατακλείσας αὐτὸν ἐφύλαττεν. ἦν δὲ ὁ λαβύρινθος, ὃν Δαίδαλος κατεσκεύασεν, οἴκημα καμπαῖς πολυπλόκοις πλανῶν τὴν ἔξοδον. τὰ μὲν οὖν περὶ Μινωταύρου καὶ Ἀνδρόγεω καὶ Φαίδρας καὶ Ἀριάδνης ἐν τοῖς περὶ Θησέως ὕστερον ἐροῦμεν.

[4] But angry at him for not sacrificing the bull, Poseidon made the animal savage, and contrived that Pasiphae should conceive a passion for it. In her love for the bull she found an accomplice in Daedalus, an architect, who had been banished from Athens for murder. He constructed a wooden cow on wheels, took it, hollowed it out in the inside, sewed it up in the hide of a cow which he had skinned, and set it in the meadow in which the bull used to graze. Then he introduced Pasiphae into it; and the bull came and coupled with it, as if it were a real cow. And she gave birth to Asterius, who was called the Minotaur. He had the face of a bull, but the rest of him was human; and Minos, in compliance with certain oracles, shut him up and guarded him in the Labyrinth. Now the Labyrinth which Daedalus constructed was a chamber “ that with its tangled windings perplexed the outward way. “ The story of the Minotaur, and Androgeus, and Phaedra, and Ariadne, I will tell hereafter in my account of Theseus.

[1] Κατρέως δὲ τοῦ Μίνωος Ἀερόπη καὶ Κλυμένη καὶ Ἀπημοσύνη καὶ Ἀλθαιμένης υἱὸς γίνονται. χρωμένῳ δὲ Κατρεῖ περὶ καταστροφῆς τοῦ βίου ὁ θεὸς ἔφη ὑπὸ ἑνὸς τῶν τέκνων τεθνήξεσθαι. Κατρεὺς μὲν οὖν ἀπεκρύβετο τοὺς χρησμούς, Ἀλθαιμένης δὲ ἀκούσας, καὶ δείσας μὴ φονεὺς γένηται τοῦ πατρός, ἄρας ἐκ Κρήτης μετὰ τῆς ἀδελφῆς Ἀπημοσύνης προσίσχει τινὶ τόπῳ τῆς Ῥόδου, καὶ κατασχὼν Κρητινίαν ὠνόμασεν. ἀναβὰς δὲ ἐπὶ τὸ Ἀταβύριον καλούμενον ὄρος ἐθεάσατο τὰς πέριξ νήσους, κατιδὼν δὲ καὶ Κρήτην, καὶ τῶν πατρῴων ὑπομνησθεὶς θεῶν, ἱδρύετο βωμὸν Ἀταβυρίου Διός. μετ᾽ οὐ πολὺ δὲ τῆς ἀδελφῆς αὐτόχειρ ἐγένετο. Ἑρμῆς γὰρ αὐτῆς ἐρασθείς, ὡς φεύγουσαν αὐτὴν καταλαβεῖν οὐκ ἠδύνατο （περιῆν γὰρ αὐτοῦ τῷ τάχει τῶν ποδῶν）, κατὰ τῆς ὁδοῦ βύρσας ὑπέστρωσε νεοδάρτους, ἐφ᾽ αἷς ὀλισθοῦσα, ἡνίκα ἀπὸ τῆς κρήνης ἐπανῄει, φθείρεται. καὶ τῷ ἀδελφῷ μηνύει τὸ γεγονός: ὁ δὲ σκῆψιν νομίσας εἶναι τὸν θεόν, λὰξ ἐνθορὼν ἀπέκτεινεν.

[1] But Catreus, son of Minos, had three daughters, Aerope, Clymene, and Apemosyne, and a son, Althaemenes. When Catreus inquired of the oracle how his life should end, the god said that he would die by the hand of one of his children. Now Catreus hid the oracles, but Althaemenes heard of them, and fearing to be his father’s murderer, he set out from Crete with his sister Apemosyne, and put in at a place in Rhodes, and having taken possession of it he called it Cretinia. And having ascended the mountain called Atabyrium, he beheld the islands round about; and descrying Crete also and calling to mind the gods of his fathers he founded an altar of Atabyrian Zeus. But not long afterwards he became the murderer of his sister. For Hermes loved her, and as she fled from him and he could not catch her, because she excelled him in speed of foot, he spread fresh hides on the path, on which, returning from the spring, she slipped and so was deflowered. She revealed to her brother what had happened, but he, deeming the god a mere pretext, kicked her to death.

[2] Ἀερόπην δὲ καὶ Κλυμένην Κατρεὺς Ναυπλίῳ δίδωσιν εἰς ἀλλοδαπὰς ἠπείρους ἀπεμπολῆσαι. τούτων Ἀερόπην μὲν ἔγημε Πλεισθένης καὶ παῖδας Ἀγαμέμνονα καὶ Μενέλαον ἐτέκνωσε, Κλυμένην δὲ γαμεῖ Ναύπλιος, καὶ τέκνων πατὴρ γίνεται Οἴακος καὶ Παλαμήδους. Κατρεὺς δὲ ὕστερον γήρᾳ κατεχόμενος ἐπόθει τὴν βασιλείαν Ἀλθαιμένει τῷ παιδὶ παραδοῦναι, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ἦλθεν εἰς Ῥόδον. ἀποβὰς δὲ τῆς νεὼς σὺν τοῖς ἥρωσι κατά τινα τῆς νήσου τόπον ἔρημον ἠλαύνετο ὑπὸ τῶν βουκόλων, λῃστὰς ἐμβεβληκέναι δοκούντων καὶ μὴ δυναμένων ἀκοῦσαι λέγοντος αὐτοῦ τὴν ἀλήθειαν διὰ τὴν κραυγὴν τῶν κυνῶν, ἀλλὰ βαλλόντων κἀκείνων, παραγενόμενος Ἀλθαιμένης ἀκοντίσας ἀπέκτεινεν ἀγνοῶν Κατρέα. μαθὼν δὲ ὕστερον τὸ γεγονός, εὐξάμενος ὑπὸ χάσματος ἐκρύβη.

[2] And Catreus gave Aerope and Clymene to Nauplius to sell into foreign lands; and of these two Aerope became the wife of Plisthenes, who begat Agamemnon and Menelaus; and Clymene became the wife of Nauplius, who became the father of Oeax and Palamedes. But afterwards in the grip of old age Catreus yearned to transmit the kingdom to his son Althaemenes, and went for that purpose to Rhodes. And having landed from the ship with the heroes at a desert place of the island, he was chased by the cowherds, who imagined that they were pirates on a raid. He told them the truth, but they could not hear him for the barking of the dogs, and while they pelted him Althaemenes arrived and killed him with the cast of a javelin, not knowing him to be Catreus. Afterwards when he learned the truth, he prayed and disappeared in a chasm.

[1] Δευκαλίωνι δὲ ἐγένοντο Ἰδομενεύς τε καὶ Κρήτη καὶ νόθος Μόλος. Γλαῦκος δὲ ἔτι νήπιος ὑπάρχων, μῦν διώκων εἰς μέλιτος πίθον πεσὼν ἀπέθανεν. ἀφανοῦς δὲ ὄντος αὐτοῦ Μίνως πολλὴν ζήτησιν ποιούμενος περὶ τῆς εὑρέσεως ἐμαντεύετο. Κούρητες δὲ εἶπον αὐτῷ τριχρώματον ἐν ταῖς ἀγέλαις ἔχειν βοῦν, τὸν δὲ τὴν ταύτης χρόαν ἄριστα εἰκάσαι δυνηθέντα καὶ ζῶντα τὸν παῖδα ἀποδώσειν. συγκληθέντων δὲ τῶν μάντεων Πολύιδος ὁ Κοιρανοῦ τὴν χρόαν τῆς βοὸς εἴκασε βάτου καρπῷ, καὶ ζητεῖν τὸν παῖδα ἀναγκασθεὶς διά τινος μαντείας ἀνεῦρε. λέγοντος δὲ Μίνωος ὅτι δεῖ καὶ ζῶντα ἀπολαβεῖν αὐτόν, ἀπεκλείσθη σὺν τῷ νεκρῷ. ἐν ἀμηχανίᾳ δὲ πολλῇ τυγχάνων εἶδε δράκοντα ἐπὶ τὸν νεκρὸν ἰόντα: τοῦτον βαλὼν λίθῳ ἀπέκτεινε, δείσας μὴ κἂν αὐτὸς τελευτήσῃ, εἴ τι τὸ σῶμα πάθοι. ἔρχεται δὲ ἕτερος δράκων, καὶ θεασάμενος νεκρὸν τὸν πρότερον ἄπεισιν, εἶτα ὑποστρέφει πόαν κομίζων, καὶ ταύτην ἐπιτίθησιν ἐπὶ πᾶν τὸ τοῦ ἑτέρου σῶμα: ἐπιτεθείσης δὲ τῆς πόας ἀνέστη. θεασάμενος δὲ Πολύιδος καὶ θαυμάσας, τὴν αὐτὴν πόαν προσενεγκὼν τῷ τοῦ Γλαύκου σώματι ἀνέστησεν.

[1] To Deucalion were born Idomeneus and Crete and a bastard son Molus. But Glaucus, while he was yet a child, in chasing a mouse fell into a jar of honey and was drowned. On his disappearance Minos made a great search and consulted diviners as to how he should find him. The Curetes told him that in his herds he had a cow of three different colors, and that the man who could best describe that cow’s color would also restore his son to him alive. So when the diviners were assembled, Polyidus, son of Coeranus, compared the color of the cow to the fruit of the bramble, and being compelled to seek for the child he found him by means of a sort of divination. But Minos declaring that he must recover him alive, he was shut up with the dead body. And while he was in great perplexity, he saw a serpent going towards the corpse. He threw a stone and killed it, fearing to be killed himself if any harm befell the body. But another serpent came, and, seeing the former one dead, departed, and then returned, bringing a herb, and placed it on the whole body of the other; and no sooner was the herb so placed upon it than the dead serpent came to life. Surprised at this sight, Polyidus applied the same herb to the body of Glaucus and raised him from the dead.

[2] ἀπολαβὼν δὲ Μίνως τὸν παῖδα οὐδ᾽ οὕτως εἰς Ἄργος ἀπιέναι τὸν Πολύιδον εἴα, πρὶν ἢ τὴν μαντείαν διδάξαι τὸν Γλαῦκον: ἀναγκασθεὶς δὲ Πολύιδος διδάσκει. καὶ ἐπειδὴ ἀπέπλει, κελεύει τὸν Γλαῦκον εἰς τὸ στόμα ἐμπτύσαι: καὶ τοῦτο ποιήσας Γλαῦκος τῆς μαντείας ἐπελάθετο. τὰ μὲν οὖν περὶ τῶν τῆς Εὐρώπης ἀπογόνων μέχρι τοῦδέ μοι λελέχθω.

[2] Minos had now got back his son, but even so he did not suffer Polyidus to depart to Argos until he had taught Glaucus the art of divination. Polyidus taught him on compulsion, and when he was sailing away he bade Glaucus spit into his mouth. Glaucus did so and forgot the art of divination. Thus much must suffice for my account of the descendants of Europa.

[1] Κάδμος δὲ ἀποθανοῦσαν θάψας Τηλέφασσαν, ὑπὸ Θρακῶν ξενισθείς, ἦλθεν εἰς Δελφοὺς περὶ τῆς Εὐρώπης πυνθανόμενος. ὁ δὲ θεὸς εἶπε περὶ μὲν Εὐρώπης μὴ πολυπραγμονεῖν, χρῆσθαι δὲ καθοδηγῷ βοΐ, καὶ πόλιν κτίζειν ἔνθα ἂν αὕτη πέσῃ καμοῦσα. τοιοῦτον λαβὼν χρησμὸν διὰ Φωκέων ἐπορεύετο, εἶτα βοῒ συντυχὼν ἐν τοῖς Πελάγοντος βουκολίοις ταύτῃ κατόπισθεν εἵπετο. ἡ δὲ διεξιοῦσα Βοιωτίαν ἐκλίθη, πόλις ἔνθα νῦν εἰσι Θῆβαι. βουλόμενος δὲ Ἀθηνᾷ καταθῦσαι τὴν βοῦν, πέμπει τινὰς τῶν μεθ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ ληψομένους ἀπὸ τῆς Ἀρείας κρήνης ὕδωρ: φρουρῶν δὲ τὴν κρήνην δράκων, ὃν ἐξ Ἄρεος εἶπόν τινες γεγονέναι, τοὺς πλείονας τῶν πεμφθέντων διέφθειρεν. ἀγανακτήσας δὲ Κάδμος κτείνει τὸν δράκοντα, καὶ τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς ὑποθεμένης τοὺς ὀδόντας αὐτοῦ σπείρει. τούτων δὲ σπαρέντων ἀνέτειλαν ἐκ γῆς ἄνδρες ἔνοπλοι, οὓς ἐκάλεσαν Σπαρτούς. οὗτοι δὲ ἀπέκτειναν ἀλλήλους, οἱ μὲν εἰς ἔριν ἀκούσιον ἐλθόντες, οἱ δὲ ἀγνοοῦντες. Φερεκύδης δέ φησιν ὅτι Κάδμος, ἰδὼν ἐκ γῆς ἀναφυομένους ἄνδρας ἐνόπλους, ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς ἔβαλε λίθους, οἱ δὲ ὑπ᾽ ἀλλήλων νομίζοντες βάλλεσθαι εἰς μάχην κατέστησαν. περιεσώθησαν δὲ πέντε, Ἐχίων Οὐδαῖος Χθονίος Ὑπερήνωρ Πέλωρος.

[1] When Telephassa died, Cadmus buried her, and after being hospitably received by the Thracians he came to Delphi to inquire about Europa. The god told him not to trouble about Europa, but to be guided by a cow, and to found a city wherever she should fall down for weariness. After receiving such an oracle he journeyed through Phocis; then falling in with a cow among the herds of Pelagon, he followed it behind. And after traversing Boeotia, it sank down where is now the city of Thebes. Wishing to sacrifice the cow to Athena, he sent some of his companions to draw water from the spring of Ares. But a dragon, which some said was the offspring of Ares, guarded the spring and destroyed most of those that were sent. In his indignation Cadmus killed the dragon, and by the advice of Athena sowed its teeth. When they were sown there rose from the ground armed men whom they called Sparti. These slew each other, some in a chance brawl, and some in ignorance. But Pherecydes says that when Cadmus saw armed men growing up out of the ground, he flung stones at them, and they, supposing that they were being pelted by each other, came to blows. However, five of them survived, Echion, Udaeus, Chthonius, Hyperenor, and Pelorus.

[2] Κάδμος δὲ ἀνθ᾽ ὧν ἔκτεινεν ἀίδιον ἐνιαυτὸν ἐθήτευσεν Ἄρει: ἦν δὲ ὁ ἐνιαυτὸς τότε ὀκτὼ ἔτη.μετὰ δὲ τὴν θητείαν Ἀθηνᾶ αὐτῷ τὴν βασιλείαν κατεσκεύασε, Ζεὺς δὲ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ γυναῖκα Ἁρμονίαν, Ἀφροδίτης καὶ Ἄρεος θυγατέρα. καὶ πάντες θεοὶ καταλιπόντες τὸν οὐρανόν, ἐν τῇ Καδμείᾳ τὸν γάμον εὐωχούμενοι καθύμνησαν. ἔδωκε δὲ αὐτῇ Κάδμος πέπλον καὶ τὸν ἡφαιστότευκτον ὅρμον, ὃν ὑπὸ Ἡφαίστου λέγουσί τινες δοθῆναι Κάδμῳ, Φερεκύδης δὲ ὑπὸ Εὐρώπης: ὃν παρὰ Διὸς αὐτὴν λαβεῖν. γίνονται δὲ Κάδμῳ θυγατέρες μὲν Αὐτονόη Ἰνὼ Σεμέλη Ἀγαυή, παῖς δὲ Πολύδωρος. Ἰνὼ μὲν οὖν Ἀθάμας ἔγημεν, Αὐτονόην δὲ Ἀρισταῖος, Ἀγαυὴν δὲ Ἐχίων.

[2] But Cadmus, to atone for the slaughter, served Ares for an eternal year; and the year was then equivalent to eight years of our reckoning.After his servitude Athena procured for him the kingdom, and Zeus gave him to wife Harmonia, daughter of Aphrodite and Ares. And all the gods quitted the sky, and feasting in the Cadmea celebrated the marriage with hymns. Cadmus gave her a robe and the necklace wrought by Hephaestus, which some say was given to Cadmus by Hephaestus, but Pherecydes says that it was given by Europa, who had received it from Zeus. And to Cadmus were born daughters, Autonoe, Ino, Semele, Agave, and a son Polydorus. Ino was married to Athamas, Autonoe to Aristaeus, and Agave to Echion.

[3] Σεμέλης δὲ Ζεὺς ἐρασθεὶς Ἥρας κρύφα συνευνάζεται. ἡ δὲ ἐξαπατηθεῖσα ὑπὸ Ἥρας, κατανεύσαντος αὐτῇ Διὸς πᾶν τὸ αἰτηθὲν ποιήσειν, αἰτεῖται τοιοῦτον αὐτὸν ἐλθεῖν οἷος ἦλθε μνηστευόμενος Ἥραν. Ζεὺς δὲ μὴ δυνάμενος ἀνανεῦσαι παραγίνεται εἰς τὸν θάλαμον αὐτῆς ἐφ᾽ ἅρματος ἀστραπαῖς ὁμοῦ καὶ βρονταῖς, καὶ κεραυνὸν ἵησιν. Σεμέλης δὲ διὰ τὸν φόβον ἐκλιπούσης, ἑξαμηνιαῖον τὸ βρέφος ἐξαμβλωθὲν ἐκ τοῦ πυρὸς ἁρπάσας ἐνέρραψε τῷ μηρῷ. ἀποθανούσης δὲ Σεμέλης, αἱ λοιπαὶ Κάδμου θυγατέρες διήνεγκαν λόγον, συνηυνῆσθαι θνητῷ τινι Σεμέλην καὶ καταψεύσασθαι Διός, καὶ ὅτι διὰ τοῦτο ἐκεραυνώθη. κατὰ δὲ τὸν χρόνον τὸν καθήκοντα Διόνυσον γεννᾷ Ζεὺς λύσας τὰ ῥάμματα, καὶ δίδωσιν Ἑρμῇ. ὁ δὲ κομίζει πρὸς Ἰνὼ καὶ Ἀθάμαντα καὶ πείθει τρέφειν ὡς κόρην. ἀγανακτήσασα δὲ Ἥρα μανίαν αὐτοῖς ἐνέβαλε, καὶ Ἀθάμας μὲν τὸν πρεσβύτερον παῖδα Λέαρχον ὡς ἔλαφον θηρεύσας ἀπέκτεινεν, Ἰνὼ δὲ τὸν Μελικέρτην εἰς πεπυρωμένον λέβητα ῥίψασα, εἶτα βαστάσασα μετὰ νεκροῦ τοῦ παιδὸς ἥλατο κατὰ βυθοῦ. καὶ Λευκοθέα μὲν αὐτὴν καλεῖται, Παλαίμων δὲ ὁ παῖς, οὕτως ὀνομασθέντες ὑπὸ τῶν πλεόντων: τοῖς χειμαζομένοις γὰρ βοηθοῦσιν. ἐτέθη δὲ ἐπὶ Μελικέρτῃ ὁ ἀγὼν τῶν Ἰσθμίων, Σισύφου θέντος. Διόνυσον δὲ Ζεὺς εἰς ἔριφον ἀλλάξας τὸν Ἥρας θυμὸν ἔκλεψε, καὶ λαβὼν αὐτὸν Ἑρμῆς πρὸς νύμφας ἐκόμισεν ἐν Νύσῃ κατοικούσας τῆς Ἀσίας, ἃς ὕστερον Ζεὺς καταστερίσας ὠνόμασεν Ὑάδας.

[3] But Zeus loved Semele and bedded with her unknown to Hera. Now Zeus had agreed to do for her whatever she asked, and deceived by Hera she asked that he would come to her as he came when he was wooing Hera. Unable to refuse, Zeus came to her bridal chamber in a chariot, with lightnings and thunderings, and launched a thunderbolt. But Semele expired of fright, and Zeus, snatching the sixth-month abortive child from the fire, sewed it in his thigh. On the death of Semele the other daughters of Cadmus spread a report that Semele had bedded with a mortal man, and had falsely accused Zeus, and that therefore she had been blasted by thunder. But at the proper time Zeus undid the stitches and gave birth to Dionysus, and entrusted him to Hermes. And he conveyed him to Ino and Athamas, and persuaded them to rear him as a girl. But Hera indignantly drove them mad, and Athamas hunted his elder son Learchus as a deer and killed him, and Ino threw Melicertes into a boiling cauldron, then carrying it with the dead child she sprang into the deep. And she herself is called Leucothea, and the boy is called Palaemon, such being the names they get from sailors; for they succour storm-tossed mariners. And the Isthmian games were instituted by Sisyphus in honor of Melicertes. But Zeus eluded the wrath of Hera by turning Dionysus into a kid, and Hermes took him and brought him to the nymphs who dwelt at Nysa in Asia, whom Zeus afterwards changed into stars and named them the Hyades.

[4] Αὐτονόης δὲ καὶ Ἀρισταίου παῖς Ἀκταίων ἐγένετο, ὃς τραφεὶς παρὰ Χείρωνι κυνηγὸς ἐδιδάχθη, καὶ ἔπειτα ὕστερον ἐν τῷ Κιθαιρῶνι κατεβρώθη ὑπὸ τῶν ἰδίων κυνῶν. καὶ τοῦτον ἐτελεύτησε τὸν τρόπον, ὡς μὲν Ἀκουσίλαος λέγει, μηνίσαντος τοῦ Διὸς ὅτι ἐμνηστεύσατο Σεμέλην, ὡς δὲ οἱ πλείονες, ὅτι τὴν Ἄρτεμιν λουομένην εἶδε. καί φασι τὴν θεὸν παραχρῆμα αὐτοῦ τὴν μορφὴν εἰς ἔλαφον ἀλλάξαι, καὶ τοῖς ἑπομένοις αὐτῷ πεντήκοντα κυσὶν ἐμβαλεῖν λύσσαν, ὑφ᾽ ὧν κατὰ ἄγνοιαν ἐβρώθη. ἀπολομένου δὲ Ἀκταίωνος οἱ κύνες ἐπιζητοῦντες τὸν δεσπότην κατωρύοντο, καὶ ζήτησιν ποιούμενοι παρεγένοντο ἐπὶ τὸ τοῦ Χείρωνος ἄντρον, ὃς εἴδωλον κατεσκεύασεν Ἀκταίωνος, ὃ καὶ τὴν λύπην αὐτῶν ἔπαυσε. “τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν Ἀκταίωνος κυνῶν ἐκ τῶν... οὕτωδὴ νῦν καλὸν σῶμα περισταδόν, ἠύτε θῆρος,τοῦδε δάσαντο κύνες κρατεροί. πέλας † Ἄρκενα πρώτη.... μετὰ ταύτην ἄλκιμα τέκνα,Λυγκεὺς καὶ Βαλίος πόδας αἰνετός, ἠδ᾽ Ἀμάρυνθος. — καὶ τούτους ὀνομαστὶ διηνεκέως κατέλεξε:καὶ τότε Ἀκταίων ἔθανεν Διὸς ἐννεσίῃσι.πρῶτοι γὰρ μέλαν αἷμα πίον σφετέροιο ἄνακτοςΣπαρτός τ᾽ Ὤμαργός τε Βορῆς τ᾽ αἰψηροκέλευθος.οὗτοι δ᾽Ἀκταίου πρῶτοι φάγον αἷμα τ᾽ ἔλαψαν.τοὺς δὲ μέτ᾽ ἄλλοι πάντες ἐπέσσυθεν ἐμμεμαῶτες. — ... ἀργαλέων ὀδυνῶν ἄκος ἔμμεναι ἀνθρώποισιν.”

[4] Autonoe and Aristaeus had a son Actaeon, who was bred by Chiron to be a hunter and then afterwards was devoured on Cithaeron by his own dogs. He perished in that way, according to Acusilaus, because Zeus was angry at him for wooing Semele; but according to the more general opinion, it was because he saw Artemis bathing. And they say that the goddess at once transformed him into a deer, and drove mad the fifty dogs in his pack, which devoured him unwittingly. Actaeon being gone, the dogs sought their master howling lamentably, and in the search they came to the cave of Chiron, who fashioned an image of Actaeon, which soothed their grief.” [ The names of Actaeon’s dogs from the . . . . So

The strong dogs rent it. Near Arcena first.

And these he enumerated continuously by name.
And then Actaeon perished at the instigation of Zeus.
For the first that drank their master’s black blood

These first ate of Actaeon and lapped his blood.
And after them others rushed on him eagerly . . . .

[1] Διόνυσος δὲ εὑρετὴς ἀμπέλου γενόμενος, Ἥρας μανίαν αὐτῷ ἐμβαλούσης περιπλανᾶται Αἴγυπτόν τε καὶ Συρίαν. καὶ τὸ μὲν πρῶτον Πρωτεὺς αὐτὸν ὑποδέχεται βασιλεὺς Αἰγυπτίων, αὖθις δὲ εἰς Κύβελα τῆς Φρυγίας ἀφικνεῖται, κἀκεῖ καθαρθεὶς ὑπὸ Ῥέας καὶ τὰς τελετὰς ἐκμαθών, καὶ λαβὼν παρ᾽ ἐκείνης τὴν στολήν, ἐπὶ Ἰνδοὺς διὰ τῆς Θράκης ἠπείγετο. Λυκοῦργος δὲ παῖς Δρύαντος, Ἠδωνῶν βασιλεύων, οἳ Στρυμόνα ποταμὸν παροικοῦσι, πρῶτος ὑβρίσας ἐξέβαλεν αὐτόν. καὶ Διόνυσος μὲν εἰς θάλασσαν πρὸς Θέτιν τὴν Νηρέως κατέφυγε, Βάκχαι δὲ ἐγένοντο αἰχμάλωτοι καὶ τὸ συνεπόμενον Σατύρων πλῆθος αὐτῷ. αὖθις δὲ αἱ Βάκχαι ἐλύθησαν ἐξαίφνης, Λυκούργῳ δὲ μανίαν ἐνεποίησε Διόνυσος. ὁ δὲ μεμηνὼς Δρύαντα τὸν παῖδα, ἀμπέλου νομίζων κλῆμα κόπτειν, πελέκει πλήξας ἀπέκτεινε, καὶ ἀκρωτηριάσας αὐτὸν ἐσωφρόνησε. τῆς δὲ γῆς ἀκάρπου μενούσης, ἔχρησεν ὁ θεὸς καρποφορήσειν αὐτήν, ἂν θανατωθῇ Λυκοῦργος.

[1] Dionysus discovered the vine, and being driven mad by Hera he roamed about Egypt and Syria. At first he was received by Proteus, king of Egypt, but afterwards he arrived at Cybela in Phrygia. And there, after he had been purified by Rhea and learned the rites of initiation, he received from her the costume and hastened through Thrace against the Indians. But Lycurgus, son of Dryas, was king of the Edonians, who dwell beside the river Strymon, and he was the first who insulted and expelled him. Dionysus took refuge in the sea with Thetis, daughter of Nereus, and the Bacchanals were taken prisoners together with the multitude of Satyrs that attended him. But afterwards the Bacchanals were suddenly released, and Dionysus drove Lycurgus mad. And in his madness he struck his son Dryas dead with an axe, imagining that he was lopping a branch of a vine, and when he had cut off his son’s extremities, he recovered his senses. But the land remaining barren, the god declared oracularly that it would bear fruit if Lycurgus were put to death. On hearing that, the Edonians led him to Mount Pangaeum and bound him, and there by the will of Dionysus he died, destroyed by horses.

[2] διελθὼν δὲ Θρᾴκην καὶ τὴν Ἰνδικὴν ἅπασαν, στήλας ἐκεῖ στήσας ἧκεν εἰς Θήβας, καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας ἠνάγκασε καταλιπούσας τὰς οἰκίας βακχεύειν ἐν τῷ Κιθαιρῶνι. Πενθεὺς δὲ γεννηθεὶς ἐξ Ἀγαυῆς Ἐχίονι, παρὰ Κάδμου εἰληφὼς τὴν βασιλείαν, διεκώλυε ταῦτα γίνεσθαι, καὶ παραγενόμενος εἰς Κιθαιρῶνα τῶν Βακχῶν κατάσκοπος ὑπὸ τῆς μητρὸς Ἀγαυῆς κατὰ μανίαν ἐμελίσθη: ἐνόμισε γὰρ αὐτὸν θηρίον εἶναι. δείξας δὲ Θηβαίοις ὅτι θεός ἐστιν, ἧκεν εἰς Ἄργος, κἀκεῖ πάλιν οὐ τιμώντων αὐτὸν ἐξέμηνε τὰς γυναῖκας. αἱ δὲ ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσι τοὺς ἐπιμαστιδίους ἔχουσαι παῖδας τὰς σάρκας αὐτῶν ἐσιτοῦντο.

[2] Having traversed Thrace and the whole of India and set up pillars there, he came to Thebes, and forced the women to abandon their houses and rave in Bacchic frenzy on Cithaeron. But Pentheus, whom Agave bore to Echion, had succeeded Cadmus in the kingdom, and he attempted to put a stop to these proceedings. And coming to Cithaeron to spy on the Bacchanals, he was torn limb from limb by his mother Agave in a fit of madness; for she thought he was a wild beast. And having shown the Thebans that he was a god, Dionysus came to Argos, and there again, because they did not honor him, he drove the women mad, and they on the mountains devoured the flesh of the infants whom they carried at their breasts.

[3] βουλόμενος δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰκαρίας εἰς Νάξον διακομισθῆναι, Τυρρηνῶν λῃστρικὴν ἐμισθώσατο τριήρη. οἱ δὲ αὐτὸν ἐνθέμενοι Νάξον μὲν παρέπλεον, ἠπείγοντο δὲ εἰς τὴν Ἀσίαν ἀπεμπολήσοντες. ὁ δὲ τὸν μὲν ἱστὸν καὶ τὰς κώπας ἐποίησεν ὄφεις, τὸ δὲ σκάφος ἔπλησε κισσοῦ καὶ βοῆς αὐλῶν: οἱ δὲ ἐμμανεῖς γενόμενοι κατὰ τῆς θαλάττης ἔφυγον καὶ ἐγένοντο δελφῖνες. ὣς δὲ αὐτὸν θεὸν ἄνθρωποι ἐτίμων, ὁ δὲ ἀναγαγὼν ἐξ Ἅιδου τὴν μητέρα, καὶ προσαγορεύσας Θυώνην, μετ᾽ αὐτῆς εἰς οὐρανὸν ἀνῆλθεν.

[3] And wishing to be ferried across from Icaria to Naxos he hired a pirate ship of Tyrrhenians. But when they had put him on board, they sailed past Naxos and made for Asia, intending to sell him. Howbeit, he turned the mast and oars into snakes, and filled the vessel with ivy and the sound of flutes. And the pirates went mad, and leaped into the sea, and were turned into dolphins. Thus men perceived that he was a god and honored him; and having brought up his mother from Hades and named her Thyone, he ascended up with her to heaven.

[4] ὁ δὲ Κάδμος μετὰ Ἁρμονίας Θήβας ἐκλιπὼν πρὸς Ἐγχελέας παραγίνεται. τούτοις δὲ ὑπὸ Ἰλλυριῶν πολεμουμένοις ὁ θεὸς ἔχρησεν Ἰλλυριῶν κρατήσειν, ἐὰν ἡγεμόνας Κάδμον καὶ Ἁρμονίαν ἔχωσιν. οἱ δὲ πεισθέντες ποιοῦνται κατὰ Ἰλλυριῶν ἡγεμόνας τούτους καὶ κρατοῦσι. καὶ βασιλεύει Κάδμος Ἰλλυριῶν, καὶ παῖς Ἰλλυριὸς αὐτῷ γίνεται. αὖθις δὲ μετὰ Ἁρμονίας εἰς δράκοντα μεταβαλὼν εἰς Ἠλύσιον πεδίον ὑπὸ Διὸς ἐξεπέμφθη.

[4] But Cadmus and Harmonia quitted Thebes and went to the Encheleans. As the Encheleans were being attacked by the Illyrians, the god declared by an oracle that they would get the better of the Illyrians if they had Cadmus and Harmonia as their leaders. They believed him, and made them their leaders against the Illyrians, and got the better of them. And Cadmus reigned over the Illyrians, and a son Illyrius was born to him. But afterwards he was, along with Harmonia, turned into a serpent and sent away by Zeus to the Elysian Fields.

[5] Πολύδωρος δὲ Θηβῶν βασιλεὺς γενόμενος Νυκτηίδα γαμεῖ, Νυκτέως τοῦ Χθονίου θυγατέρα, καὶ γεννᾷ Λάβδακον. οὗτος ἀπώλετο, μετὰ Πενθέα ἐκείνῳ φρονῶν παραπλήσια. καταλιπόντος δὲ Λαβδάκου παῖδα ἐνιαυσιαῖον Λάιον, τὴν ἀρχὴν ἀφείλετο Λύκος, ἕως οὗτος ἦν παῖς, ἀδελφὸς ὢν Νυκτέως. ἀμφότεροι δὲ ἀπὸ Εὐβοίας φυγὸντες, ἐπεὶ Φλεγύαν ἀπέκτειναν τὸν Ἄρεος καὶ Δωτίδος τῆς Βοιωτίδος, Ὑρίαν κατῴκουν, καὶ ... διὰ τὴν πρὸς Πενθέα οἰκειότητα ἐγεγόνεσαν πολῖται. αἱρεθεὶς οὖν Λύκος πολέμαρχος ὑπὸ Θηβαίων ἐπέθετο τῇ δυναστείᾳ, καὶ βασιλεύσας ἔτη εἴκοσι, φονευθεὶς ὑπὸ Ζήθου καὶ Ἀμφίονος θνήσκει δι᾽ αἰτίαν τήνδε. Ἀντιόπη θυγάτηρ ἦν Νυκτέως: ταύτῃ Ζεὺς συνῆλθεν. ἡ δὲ ὡς ἔγκυος ἐγένετο, τοῦ πατρὸς ἀπειλοῦντος εἰς Σικυῶνα ἀποδιδράσκει πρὸς Ἐπωπέα καὶ τούτῳ γαμεῖται. Νυκτεὺς δὲ ἀθυμήσας ἑαυτὸν φονεύει, δοὺς ἐντολὰς Λύκῳ παρὰ Ἐπωπέως καὶ παρὰ Ἀντιόπης λαβεῖν δίκας. ὁ δὲ στρατευσάμενος Σικυῶνα χειροῦται, καὶ τὸν μὲν Ἐπωπέα κτείνει, τὴν δὲ Ἀντιόπην ἤγαγεν αἰχμάλωτον. ἡ δὲ ἀγομένη δύο γεννᾷ παῖδας ἐν Ἐλευθεραῖς τῆς Βοιωτίας, οὓς ἐκκειμένους εὑρὼν βουκόλος ἀνατρέφει, καὶ τὸν μὲν καλεῖ Ζῆθον τὸν δὲ Ἀμφίονα.

Ἀντιόπην δὲ ᾐκίζετο Λύκος καθείρξας καὶ ἡ τούτου γυνὴ Δίρκη: λαθοῦσα δέ ποτε, τῶν δεσμῶν αὐτομάτως λυθέντων, ἧκεν ἐπὶ τὴν τῶν παίδων ἔπαυλιν, δεχθῆναι πρὸς αὐτῶν θέλουσα. οἱ δὲ ἀναγνωρισάμενοι τὴν μητέρα, τὸν μὲν Λύκον κτείνουσι, τὴν δὲ Δίρκην δήσαντες ἐκ ταύρου ῥίπτουσι θανοῦσαν εἰς κρήνην τὴν ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνης καλουμένην Δίρκην. παραλαβόντες δὲ τὴν δυναστείαν τὴν μὲν πόλιν ἐτείχισαν, ἐπακολουθησάντων τῇ Ἀμφίονος λύρᾳ τῶν λίθων, Λάιον δὲ ἐξέβαλον. ὁ δὲ ἐν Πελοποννήσῳ διατελῶν ἐπιξενοῦται Πέλοπι, καὶ τούτου παῖδα Χρύσιππον ἁρματοδρομεῖν διδάσκων ἐρασθεὶς ἀναρπάζει.

[5] Polydorus, having become king of Thebes, married Nycteis, daughter of Nycteus, son of Chthonius, and begat Labdacus, who perished after Pentheus because he was like-minded with him. But Labdacus having left a year -old son, Laius, the government was usurped by Lycus, brother of Nycteus, so long as Laius was a child. Both of them had fled [ from Euboea] because they had killed Phlegyas, son of Ares and Dotis the Boeotian, and they took up their abode at Hyria, and thence having come to Thebes, they were enrolled as citizens through their friendship with Pentheus. So after being chosen commander-in-chief by the Thebans, Lycus compassed the supreme power and reigned for twenty years, but was murdered by Zethus and Amphion for the following reason. Antiope was a daughter of Nycteus, and Zeus had intercourse with her. When she was with child, and her father threatened her, she ran away to Epopeus at Sicyon and was married to him. In a fit of despondency Nycteus killed himself, after charging Lycus to punish Epopeus and Antiope. Lycus marched against Sicyon, subdued it, slew Epopeus, and led Antiope away captive. On the way she gave birth to two sons at Eleurethae in Boeotia. The infants were exposed, but a neatherd found and reared them, and he called the one Zethus and the other Amphion. Now Zethus paid attention to cattle-breeding, but Amphion practised minstrelsy, for Hermes had given him a lyre. But Lycus and his wife Dirce imprisoned Antiope and treated her despitefully. Howbeit, one day her bonds were loosed of themselves, and unknown to her keepers she came to her sons cottage, begging that they would take her in. They recognized their mother and slew Lycus, but Dirce they tied to a bull, and flung her dead body into the spring that is called Dirce after her. And having succeeded to the sovereignty they fortified the city, the stones following Amphion’s lyre; and they expelled Laius. He resided in Peloponnese, being hospitably received by Pelops; and while he taught Chrysippus, the son of Pelops, to drive a chariot, he conceived a passion for the lad and carried him off.

[6] γαμεῖ δὲ Ζῆθος μὲν Θήβην, ἀφ᾽ ἧς ἡ πόλις Θῆβαι, Ἀμφίων δὲ Νιόβην τὴν Ταντάλου, ἣ γεννᾷ παῖδας μὲν ἑπτά, Σίπυλον Εὐπίνυτον Ἰσμηνὸν Δαμασίχθονα Ἀγήνορα Φαίδιμον Τάνταλον, θυγατέρας δὲ τὰς ἴσας, Ἐθοδαΐαν （ἢ ὥς τινες Νέαιραν） Κλεόδοξαν Ἀστυόχην Φθίαν Πελοπίαν Ἀστυκράτειαν Ὠγυγίαν. Ἡσίοδος δὲ δέκα μὲν υἱοὺς δέκα δὲ θυγατέρας, Ἡρόδωρος δὲ δύο μὲν ἄρρενας τρεῖς δὲ θηλείας, Ὅμηρος δὲ ἓξ μὲν υἱοὺς ἓξ δὲ θυγατέρας φησὶ γενέσθαι. εὔτεκνος δὲ οὖσα Νιόβη τῆς Λητοῦς εὐτεκνοτέρα εἶπεν ὑπάρχειν: Λητὼ δὲ ἀγανακτήσασα τήν τε Ἄρτεμιν καὶ τὸν Ἀπόλλωνα κατ᾽ αὐτῶν παρώξυνε, καὶ τὰς μὲν θηλείας ἐπὶ τῆς οἰκίας κατετόξευσεν Ἄρτεμις, τοὺς δὲ ἄρρενας κοινῇ πάντας ἐν Κιθαιρῶνι Ἀπόλλων κυνηγετοῦντας ἀπέκτεινεν. ἐσώθη δὲ τῶν μὲν ἀρρένων Ἀμφίων, τῶν δὲ θηλειῶν Χλωρὶς ἡ πρεσβυτέρα, ᾗ Νηλεὺς συνῴκησε. κατὰ δὲ Τελέσιλλαν ἐσώθησαν Ἀμύκλας καὶ Μελίβοια, ἐτοξεύθη δὲ ὑπ᾽ αὐτῶν καὶ Ἀμφίων, αὐτὴ δὲ Νιόβη Θήβας ἀπολιποῦσα πρὸς τὸν πατέρα Τάνταλον ἧκεν εἰς Σίπυλον, κἀκεῖ Διὶ εὐξαμένη τὴν μορφὴν εἰς λίθον μετέβαλε, καὶ χεῖται δάκρυα νύκτωρ καὶ μεθ᾽ ἡμέραν τοῦ λίθου.

[6] Zethus married Thebe, after whom the city of Thebes is named; and Amphion married Niobe, daughter of Tantalus, who bore seven sons, Sipylus, Eupinytus, Ismenus, Damasichthon, Agenor, Phaedimus, Tantalus, and the same number of daughters, Ethodaia （ or, as some say, Neaera）, Cleodoxa, Astyoche, Phthia, Pelopia, Astycratia, and Ogygia, But Hesiod says that they had ten sons and ten daughters; Herodorus that they had two male children and three female; and Homer that they had six sons and six daughters. Being blessed with children, Niobe said that she was more blessed with children than Latona. Stung by the taunt, Latona incited Artemis and Apollo against them, and Artemis shot down the females in the house, and Apollo killed all the males together as they were hunting on Cithaeron. Of the males Amphion alone was saved, and of the females Chloris the elder, whom Neleus married. But according to Telesilla there were saved Amyclas and Meliboea, and Amphion also was shot by them. But Niobe herself quitted Thebes and went to her father Tantalus at Sipylus, and there, on praying to Zeus, she was transformed into a stone, and tears flow night and day from the stone.

[7] μετὰ δὲ τὴν Ἀμφίονος τελευτὴν Λάιος τὴν βασιλείαν παρέλαβε. καὶ γήμας θυγατέρα Μενοικέως, ἣν ἔνιοι μὲν Ἰοκάστην ἔνιοι δὲ Ἐπικάστην λέγουσι, χρήσαντος τοῦ θεοῦ μὴ γεννᾶν （τὸν γεννηθέντα γὰρ πατροκτόνον ἔσεσθαι） ὁ δὲ οἰνωθεὶς συνῆλθε τῇ γυναικί. καὶ τὸ γεννηθὲν ἐκθεῖναι δίδωσι νομεῖ, περόναις διατρήσας τὰ σφυρά. ἀλλ᾽ οὗτος μὲν ἐξέθηκεν εἰς Κιθαιρῶνα, Πολύβου δὲ βουκόλοι, τοῦ Κορινθίων βασιλέως, τὸ βρέφος εὑρόντες πρὸς τὴν αὐτοῦ γυναῖκα Περίβοιαν ἤνεγκαν. ἡ δὲ ἀνελοῦσα ὑποβάλλεται, καὶ θεραπεύσασα τὰ σφυρὰ Οἰδίπουν καλεῖ, τοῦτο θεμένη τὸ ὄνομα διὰ τὸ τοὺς πόδας ἀνοιδῆσαι. τελειωθεὶς δὲ ὁ παῖς, καὶ διαφέρων τῶν ἡλίκων ῥώμῃ, διὰ φθόνον ὠνειδίζετο ὑπόβλητος. ὁ δὲ πυνθανόμενος παρὰ τῆς Περιβοίας μαθεῖν οὐκ ἠδύνατο: ἀφικόμενος δὲ εἰς Δελφοὺς περὶ τῶν ἰδίων ἐπυνθάνετο γονέων. ὁ δὲ θεὸς εἶπεν αὐτῷ εἰς τὴν πατρίδα μὴ πορεύεσθαι: τὸν μὲν γὰρ πατέρα φονεύσειν, τῇ μητρὶ δὲ μιγήσεσθαι. τοῦτο ἀκούσας, καὶ νομίζων ἐξ ὧν ἐλέγετο γεγεννῆσθαι, Κόρινθον μὲν ἀπέλιπεν, ἐφ᾽ ἅρματος δὲ διὰ τῆς Φωκίδος φερόμενος συντυγχάνει κατά τινα στενὴν ὁδὸν ἐφ᾽ ἅρματος ὀχουμένῳ Λαΐῳ. καὶ Πολυφόντου （κῆρυξ δὲ οὗτος ἦν Λαΐου） κελεύοντος ἐκχωρεῖν καὶ δι᾽ ἀπείθειαν καὶ ἀναβολὴν κτείναντος τῶν ἵππων τὸν ἕτερον, ἀγανακτήσας Οἰδίπους καὶ Πολυφόντην καὶ Λάιον ἀπέκτεινε, καὶ παρεγένετο εἰς Θήβας.

[7] After Amphion’s death Laius succeeded to the kingdom. And he married a daughter of Menoeceus; some say that she was Jocasta, and some that she was Epicasta. The oracle had warned him not to beget a son, for the son that should be begotten would kill his father; nevertheless, flushed with wine, he had intercourse with his wife. And when the babe was born he pierced the child’s ankles with brooches and gave it to a herdsman to expose. But the herdsman exposed it on Cithaeron; and the neatherds of Polybus, king of Corinth, found the infant and brought it to his wife Periboea. She adopted him and passed him off as her own, and after she had healed his ankles she called him Oedipus, giving him that name on account of his swollen feet. When the boy grew up and excelled his fellows in strength, they spitefully twitted him with being supposititious. He inquired of Periboea, but could learn nothing; so he went to Delphi and inquired about his true parents. The god told him not to go to his native land, because he would murder his father and lie with his mother. On hearing that, and believing himself to be the son of his nominal parents, he left Corinth, and riding in a chariot through Phocis he fell in with Laius driving in a chariot in a certain narrow road. And when Polyphontes, the herald of Laius, ordered him to make way and killed one of his horses because he disobeyed and delayed, Oedipus in a rage killed both Polyphontes and Laius, and arrived in Thebes.

[8] Λάιον μὲν οὖν θάπτει βασιλεὺς Πλαταιέων Δαμασίστρατος, τὴν δὲ βασιλείαν Κρέων ὁ Μενοικέως παραλαμβάνει. τούτου δὲ βασιλεύοντος οὐ μικρὰ συμφορὰ κατέσχε Θήβας. ἔπεμψε γὰρ Ἥρα Σφίγγα, ἣ μητρὸς μὲν Ἐχίδνης ἦν πατρὸς δὲ Τυφῶνος, εἶχε δὲ πρόσωπον μὲν γυναικός, στῆθος δὲ καὶ βάσιν καὶ οὐρὰν λέοντος καὶ πτέρυγας ὄρνιθος. μαθοῦσα δὲ αἴνιγμα παρὰ μουσῶν ἐπὶ τὸ Φίκιον ὄρος ἐκαθέζετο, καὶ τοῦτο προύτεινε Θηβαίοις. ἦν δὲ τὸ αἴνιγμα: τί ἐστιν ὃ μίαν ἔχον φωνὴν τετράπουν καὶ δίπουν καὶ τρίπουν γίνεται: χρησμοῦ δὲ Θηβαίοις ὑπάρχοντος τηνικαῦτα ἀπαλλαγήσεσθαι τῆς Σφιγγὸς ἡνίκα ἂν τὸ αἴνιγμα λύσωσι, συνιόντες εἰς ταὐτὸ πολλάκις ἐζήτουν τί τὸ λεγόμενόν ἐστιν, ἐπεὶ δὲ μὴ εὕρισκον, ἁρπάσασα ἕνα κατεβίβρωσκε. πολλῶν δὲ ἀπολομένων, καὶ τὸ τελευταῖον Αἵμονος τοῦ Κρέοντος, κηρύσσει Κρέων τῷ τὸ αἴνιγμα λύσοντι καὶ τὴν βασιλείαν καὶ τὴν Λαΐου δώσειν γυναῖκα. Οἰδίπους δὲ ἀκούσας ἔλυσεν, εἰπὼν τὸ αἴνιγμα τὸ ὑπὸ τῆς Σφιγγὸς λεγόμενον ἄνθρωπον εἶναι: γίνεσθαι, γὰρ τετράπουν βρέφος ὄντα τοῖς τέτταρσιν ὀχούμενον κώλοις, τελειούμενον δὲ δίπουν, γηρῶντα δὲ τρίτην προσλαμβάνειν βάσιν τὸ βάκτρον. ἡ μὲν οὖν Σφὶγξ ἀπὸ τῆς ἀκροπόλεως ἑαυτὴν ἔρριψεν, Οἰδίπους δὲ καὶ τὴν βασιλείαν παρέλαβε καὶ τὴν μητέρα ἔγημεν ἀγνοῶν, καὶ παῖδας ἐτέκνωσεν ἐξ αὐτῆς Πολυνείκη καὶ Ἐτεοκλέα, θυγατέρας δὲ Ἰσμήνην καὶ Ἀντιγόνην. εἰσὶ δὲ οἳ γεννηθῆναι τὰ τέκνα φασὶν ἐξ Εὐρυγανείας αὐτῷ τῆς Ὑπέρφαντος.

[8] Laius was buried by Damasistratus, king of Plataea, and Creon, son of Menoeceus, succeeded to the kingdom. In his reign a heavy calamity befell Thebes. For Hera sent the Sphinx, whose mother was Echidna and her father Typhon; and she had the face of a woman, the breast and feet and tail of a lion, and the wings of a bird. And having learned a riddle from the Muses, she sat on Mount Phicium, and propounded it to the Thebans. And the riddle was this: — What is that which has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and two-footed and three-footed? Now the Thebans were in possession of an oracle which declared that they should be rid of the Sphinx whenever they had read her riddle; so they often met and discussed the answer, and when they could not find it the Sphinx used to snatch away one of them and gobble him up. When many had perished, and last of all Creon’s son Haemon, Creon made proclamation that to him who should read the riddle he would give both the kingdom and the wife of Laius. On hearing that, Oedipus found the solution, declaring that the riddle of the Sphinx referred to man; for as a babe he is four-footed, going on four limbs, as an adult he is two-footed, and as an old man he gets besides a third support in a staff. So the Sphinx threw herself from the citadel, and Oedipus both succeeded to the kingdom and unwittingly married his mother, and begat sons by her, Polynices and Eteocles, and daughters, Ismene and Antigone. But some say the children were borne to him by Eurygania, daughter of Hyperphas.

[9] φανέντων δὲ ὕστερον τῶν λανθανόντων, Ἰοκάστη μὲν ἐξ ἀγχόνης ἑαυτὴν ἀνήρτησεν, Οἰδίπους δὲ τὰς ὄψεις τυφλώσας ἐκ Θηβῶν ἠλαύνετο, ἀρὰς τοῖς παισὶ θέμενος, οἳ τῆς πόλεως αὐτὸν ἐκβαλλόμενον θεωροῦντες οὐκ ἐπήμυναν. παραγενόμενος δὲ σὺν Ἀντιγόνῃ τῆς Ἀττικῆς εἰς Κολωνόν, ἔνθα τὸ τῶν Εὐμενίδων ἐστὶ τέμενος, καθίζει ἱκέτης, προσδεχθεὶς ὑπὸ Θησέως, καὶ μετ᾽ οὐ πολὺν χρόνον ἀπέθανεν.

[9] When the secret afterwards came to light, Jocasta hanged herself in a noose, and Oedipus was driven from Thebes, after he had put out his eyes and cursed his sons, who saw him cast out of the city without lifting a hand to help him. And having come with Antigone to Colonus in Attica, where is the precinct of the Eumenides, he sat down there as a suppliant, was kindly received by Theseus, and died not long afterwards.

[1] Ἐτεοκλῆς δὲ καὶ Πολυνείκης περὶ τῆς βασιλείας συντίθενται πρὸς ἀλλήλους, καὶ αὐτοῖς δοκεῖ τὸν ἕτερον παρ᾽ ἐνιαυτὸν ἄρχειν. τινὲς μὲν οὖν λέγουσι πρῶτον ἄρξαντα Πολυνείκη παραδοῦναι μετ᾽ ἐνιαυτὸν τὴν βασιλείαν Ἐτεοκλεῖ, τινὲς δὲ πρῶτον Ἐτεοκλέα ἄρξαντα μὴ βούλεσθαι παραδοῦναι τὴν βασιλείαν. φυγαδευθεὶς οὖν Πολυνείκης ἐκ Θηβῶν ἧκεν εἰς Ἄργος, τόν τε ὅρμον καὶ τὸν πέπλον ἔχων. ἐβασίλευε δὲ Ἄργους Ἄδραστος ὁ Ταλαοῦ: καὶ τοῖς τούτου βασιλείοις νύκτωρ προσπελάζει, καὶ συνάπτει μάχην Τυδεῖ τῷ Οἰνέως φεύγοντι Καλυδῶνα. γενομένης δὲ ἐξαίφνης βοῆς ἐπιφανεὶς Ἄδραστος διέλυσεν αὐτούς, καὶ μάντεώς τινος ὑπομνησθεὶς λέγοντος αὐτῷ κάπρῳ καὶ λέοντι συζεῦξαι τὰς θυγατέρας, ἀμφοτέρους εἵλετο νυμφίους: εἶχον γὰρ ἐπὶ τῶν ἀσπίδων ὁ μὲν κάπρου προτομὴν ὁ δὲ λέοντος. γαμεῖ δὲ Δηιπύλην μὲν Τυδεὺς Ἀργείην δὲ Πολυνείκης, καὶ αὐτοὺς Ἄδραστος ἀμφοτέρους εἰς τὰς πατρίδας ὑπέσχετο κατάξειν. καὶ πρῶτον ἐπὶ Θήβας ἔσπευδε στρατεύεσθαι, καὶ τοὺς ἀριστέας συνήθροιζεν.

[1] Now Eteocles and Polynices made a compact with each other concerning the kingdom and resolved that each should rule alternately for a year at a time. Some say that Polynices was the first to rule, and that after a year he handed over the kingdom to Eteocles; but some say that Eteocles was the first to rule, and would not hand over the kingdom. So, being banished from Thebes, Polynices came to Argos, taking with him the necklace and the robe. The king of Argos was Adrastus, son of Talaus; and Polynices went up to his palace by night and engaged in a fight with Tydeus, son of Oeneus, who had fled from Calydon. At the sudden outcry Adrastus appeared and parted them, and remembering the words of a certain seer who told him to yoke his daughters in marriage to a boar and a lion, he accepted them both as bridegrooms, because they had on their shields, the one the forepart of a boar, and the other the forepart of a lion. And Tydeus married Deipyle, and Polynices married Argia; and Adrastus promised that he would restore them both to their native lands. And first he was eager to march against Thebes, and he mustered the chiefs.

[2] Ἀμφιάραος δὲ ὁ Ὀικλέους, μάντις ὢν καὶ προειδὼς ὅτι δεῖ πάντας τοὺς στρατευσαμένους χωρὶς Ἀδράστου τελευτῆσαι, αὐτός τε ὤκνει στρατεύεσθαι καὶ τοὺς λοιποὺς ἀπέτρεπε. Πολυνείκης δὲ ἀφικόμενος πρὸς Ἶφιν τὸν Ἀλέκτορος ἠξίου μαθεῖν πῶς ἂν Ἀμφιάραος ἀναγκασθείη στρατεύεσθαι: ὁ δὲ εἶπεν εἰ λάβοι τὸν ὅρμον Ἐριφύλη. Ἀμφιάραος μὲν οὖν ἀπεῖπεν Ἐριφύλῃ παρὰ Πολυνείκους δῶρα λαμβάνειν, Πολυνείκης δὲ δοὺς αὐτῇ τὸν ὅρμον ἠξίου τὸν Ἀμφιάραον πεῖσαι στρατεύειν. ἦν γὰρ ἐπὶ ταύτῃ: γενομένης γὰρ †αὐτῆσπρὸς Ἄδραστον, διαλυσάμενος ὤμοσε, περὶ ὧν ἂν Ἀδράστῳ διαφέρηται, διακρίνειν Ἐριφύλῃ συγχωρῆσαι. ὅτε οὖν ἐπὶ Θήβας ἔδει στρατεύειν, Ἀδράστου μὲν παρακαλοῦντος Ἀμφιαράου δὲ ἀποτρέποντος, Ἐριφύλη τὸν ὅρμον λαβοῦσα ἔπεισεν αὐτὸν σὺν Ἀδράστῳ στρατεύειν. Ἀμφιάραος δὲ ἀνάγκην ἔχων στρατεύεσθαι τοῖς παισὶν ἐντολὰς ἔδωκε τελειωθεῖσι τήν τε μητέρα κτείνειν καὶ ἐπὶ Θήβας στρατεύειν.

[2] But Amphiaraus, son of Oicles, being a seer and foreseeing that all who joined in the expedition except Adrastus were destined to perish, shrank from it himself and discouraged the rest. However, Polynices went to Iphis, son of Alector, and begged to know how Amphiaraus could be compelled to go to the war. He answered that it could be done if Eriphyle got the necklace. Now Amphiaraus had forbidden Eriphyle to accept gifts from Polynices; but Polynices gave her the necklace and begged her to persuade Amphiaraus to go to the war; for the decision lay with her, because once, when a difference arose between him and Adrastus, he had made it up with him and sworn to let Eriphyle decide any future dispute he might have with Adrastus. Accordingly, when war was to be made on Thebes, and the measure was advocated by Adrastus and opposed by Amphiaraus, Eriphyle accepted the necklace and persuaded him to march with Adrastus. Thus forced to go to the war, Amphiaraus laid his commands on his sons, that, when they were grown up, they should slay their mother and march against Thebes.

[3] Ἄδραστος δὲ συναθροίσας στρατὸν σὺν ἡγεμόσιν ἑπτὰ πολεμεῖν ἔσπευδε Θήβας. οἱ δὲ ἡγεμόνες ἦσαν οἵδε: Ἄδραστος Ταλαοῦ, Ἀμφιάραος Ὀικλέους, Καπανεὺς Ἱππονόου, Ἱππομέδων Ἀριστομάχου, οἱ δὲ λέγουσι Ταλαοῦ. οὗτοι μὲν ἐξ Ἄργους, Πολυνείκης δὲ Οἰδίποδος ἐκ Θηβῶν, Τυδεὺς Οἰνέως Αἰτωλός, Παρθενοπαῖος Μελανίωνος Ἀρκάς. τινὲς δὲ Τυδέα μὲν καὶ Πολυνείκην οὐ καταριθμοῦσι, συγκαταλέγουσι δὲ τοῖς ἑπτὰ Ἐτέοκλον Ἴφιος καὶ Μηκιστέα.

[3] Having mustered an army with seven leaders, Adrastus hastened to wage war on Thebes. The leaders were these: Adrastus, son of Talaus; Amphiaraus, son of Oicles; Capaneus, son of Hipponous; Hippomedon, son of Aristomachus, but some say of Talaus. These came from Argos; but Polynices, son of Oedipus, came from Thebes; Tydeus, son of Oeneus, was an Aetolian; Parthenopaeus, son of Melanion, was an Arcadian. Some, however, do not reckon Tydeus and Polynices among them, but include Eteoclus, son of Iphis, and Mecisteus in the list of the seven.

[4] παραγενόμενοι δὲ εἰς Νεμέαν, ἧς ἐβασίλευε Λυκοῦργος, ἐζήτουν ὕδωρ. καὶ αὐτοῖς ἡγήσατο τῆς ἐπὶ κρήνην ὁδοῦ Ὑψιπύλη, νήπιον παῖδα ὄντα Ὀφέλτην ἀπολιποῦσα, ὃν ἔτρεφεν Εὐρυδίκης ὄντα καὶ Λυκούργου. αἰσθόμεναι γὰρ αἱ Λήμνιαι ὕστερον Θόαντα σεσωσμένον ἐκεῖνον μὲν ἔκτειναν, τὴν δὲ Ὑψιπύλην ἀπημπόλησαν: διὸ πραθεῖσα ἐλάτρευε παρὰ Λυκούργῳ. δεικνυούσης δὲ τὴν κρήνην, ὁ παῖς ἀπολειφθεὶς ὑπὸ δράκοντος διαφθείρεται. τὸν μὲν οὖν δράκοντα ἐπιφανέντες οἱ μετὰ Ἀδράστου κτείνουσι, τὸν δὲ παῖδα θάπτουσιν. Ἀμφιάραος δὲ εἷπεν ἐκείνοις τὸ σημεῖον τὰ μέλλοντα προμαντεύεσθαι: τὸν δὲ παῖδα Ἀρχέμορον ἐκάλεσαν. οἱ δὲ ἔθεσαν ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ τὸν τῶν Νεμέων ἀγῶνα, καὶ ἵππῳ μὲν ἐνίκησεν Ἄδραστος, σταδίῳ δὲ Ἐτέοκλος, πυγμῇ Τυδεύς, ἅλματι καὶ δίσκῳ Ἀμφιάραος, ἀκοντίῳ Λαόδοκος, πάλῃ Πολυνείκης, τόξῳ Παρθενοπαῖος.

[4] Having come to Nemea, of which Lycurgus was king, they sought for water; and Hypsipyle showed them the way to a spring, leaving behind an infant boy Opheltes, whom she nursed, a child of Eurydice and Lycurgus. For the Lemnian women, afterwards learning that Thoas had been saved alive, put him to death and sold Hypsipyle into slavery; wherefore she served in the house of Lycurgus as a purchased bondwoman. But while she showed the spring, the abandoned boy was killed by a serpent. When Adrastus and his party appeared on the scene, they slew the serpent and buried the boy; but Amphiaraus told them that the sign foreboded the future, and they called the boy Archemorus. They celebrated the Nemean games in his honor; and Adrastus won the horse race, Eteoclus the footrace, Tydeus the boxing match, Amphiaraus the leaping and quoit-throwing match, Laodocus the javelin-throwing match, Polynices the wrestling match, and Parthenopaeus the archery match.

[5] ὡς δὲ ἦλθον εἰς τὸν Κιθαιρῶνα, πέμπουσι Τυδέα προεροῦντα Ἐτεοκλεῖ τῆς βασιλείας παραχωρεῖν Πολυνείκει, καθὰ συνέθεντο. μὴ προσέχοντος δὲ Ἐτεοκλέους, διάπειραν τῶν Θηβαίων Τυδεὺς ποιούμενος, καθ᾽ ἕνα προκαλούμενος πάντων περιεγένετο. οἱ δὲ πεντήκοντα ἄνδρας ὁπλίσαντες ἀπιόντα ἐνήδρευσαν αὐτόν: πάντας δὲ αὐτοὺς χωρὶς Μαίονος ἀπέκτεινε, κἄπειτα ἐπὶ τὸ στρατόπεδον ἦλθεν.

[5] When they came to Cithaeron, they sent Tydeus to tell Eteocles in advance that he must cede the kingdom to Polynices, as they had agreed among themselves. As Eteocles paid no heed to the message, Tydeus, by way of putting the Thebans to the proof, challenged them to single combat and was victorious in every encounter; and though the Thebans set fifty armed men to lie in wait for him as he went away, he slew them all but Maeon, and then came to the camp.

[6] Ἀργεῖοι δὲ καθοπλισθέντες προσῄεσαν τοῖς τείχεσι, καὶ πυλῶν ἑπτὰ οὐσῶν Ἄδραστος μὲν παρὰ τὰς Ὁμολωίδας πύλας ἔστη, Καπανεὺς δὲ παρὰ τὰς Ὠγυγίας, Ἀμφιάραος δὲ παρὰ τὰς Προιτίδας, Ἱππομέδων δὲ παρὰ τὰς Ὀγκαΐδας, Πολυνείκης δὲ παρὰ τὰς Ὑψίστας, Παρθενοπαῖος δὲ παρὰ τὰς Ἠλέκτρας, Τυδεὺς δὲ παρὰ τὰς Κρηνίδας. καθώπλισε δὲ καὶ Ἐτεοκλῆς Θηβαίους, καὶ καταστήσας ἡγεμόνας ἴσους ἴσοις ἔταξε, καὶ πῶς ἂν περιγένοιντο τῶν πολεμίων ἐμαντεύετο.

[6] Having armed themselves, the Argives approached the walls; and as there were seven gates, Adrastus was stationed at the Homoloidian gate, Capaneus at the Ogygian, Amphiaraus at the Proetidian, Hippomedon at the Oncaidian, Polynices at the Hypsistan, Parthenopaeus at the Electran, and Tydeus at the Crenidian. Eteocles on his side armed the Thebans, and having appointed leaders to match those of the enemy in number, he put the battle in array, and resorted to divination to learn how they might overcome the foe.

[7] ἦν δὲ παρὰ Θηβαίοις μάντις Τειρεσίας Εὐήρους καὶ Χαρικλοῦς νύμφης, ἀπὸ γένους Οὐδαίου τοῦ Σπαρτοῦ, γενόμενος τυφλὸς τὰς ὁράσεις. οὗ περὶ τῆς πηρώσεως καὶ τῆς μαντικῆς λέγονται λόγοι διάφοροι. ἄλλοι μὲν γὰρ αὐτὸν ὑπὸ θεῶν φασι τυφλωθῆναι, ὅτι τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἃ κρύπτειν ἤθελον ἐμήνυε, Φερεκύδης δὲ ὑπὸ Ἀθηνᾶς αὐτὸν τυφλωθῆναι: οὖσαν γὰρ τὴν Χαρικλὼ προσφιλῆ τῇ Ἀθηνᾶ ... γυμνὴν ἐπὶ πάντα ἰδεῖν, τὴν δὲ ταῖς χερσὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ καταλαβομένην πηρὸν ποιῆσαι, Χαρικλοῦς δὲ δεομένης ἀποκαταστῆσαι πάλιν τὰς ὁράσεις, μὴ δυναμένην τοῦτο ποιῆσαι, τὰς ἀκοὰς διακαθάρασαν πᾶσαν ὀρνίθων φωνὴν ποιῆσαι συνεῖναι, καὶ σκῆπτρον αὐτῷ δωρήσασθαι κράνειον, ὃ φέρων ὁμοίως τοῖς βλέπουσιν ἐβάδιζεν. Ἡσίοδος δέ φησιν ὅτι θεασάμενος περὶ Κυλλήνην ὄφεις συνουσιάζοντας καὶ τούτους τρώσας ἐγένετο ἐξ ἀνδρὸς γυνή, πάλιν δὲ τοὺς αὐτοὺς ὄφεις παρατηρήσας συνουσιάζοντας ἐγένετο ἀνήρ. διόπερ Ἥρα καὶ Ζεὺς ἀμφισβητοῦντες πότερον τὰς γυναῖκας ἢ τοὺς ἄνδρας ἥδεσθαι μᾶλλον ἐν ταῖς συνουσίαις συμβαίνοι, τοῦτον ἀνέκριναν. ὁ δὲ ἔφη δέκα μοιρῶν περὶ τὰς συνουσίας οὐσῶν τὴν μὲν μίαν ἄνδρας ἥδεσθαι, τὰς δὲ ἐννέα γυναῖκας. ὅθεν Ἥρα μὲν αὐτὸν ἐτύφλωσε, Ζεὺς δὲ τὴν μαντικὴν αὐτῷ ἔδωκεν. “τὸ ὑπὸ Τειρεσίου λεχθὲν πρὸς Δία καὶ Ἥραν:οἴην μὲν μοῖραν δέκα μοιρῶν τέρπεται ἀνήρ,τὰς δὲ δέκ᾽ ἐμπίπλησι γυνὴ τέρπουσα νόημα.” ἐγένετο δὲ καὶ πολυχρόνιος.οὗτος οὗν Θηβαίοις μαντευομένοις εἶπε νικήσειν, ἐὰν Μενοικεὺς ὁ Κρέοντος Ἄρει σφάγιον αὑτὸν ἐπιδῷ. τοῦτο ἀκούσας Μενοικεὺς ὁ Κρέοντος ἑαυτὸν πρὸ τῶν πυλῶν ἔσφαξε. μάχης δὲ γενομένης οἱ Καδμεῖοι μέχρι τῶν τειχῶν συνεδιώχθησαν, καὶ Καπανεὺς ἁρπάσας κλίμακα ἐπὶ τὰ τείχη δι᾽ αὐτῆς ἀνῄει, καὶ Ζεὺς αὐτὸν κεραυνοῖ.

[7] Now there was among the Thebans a soothsayer, Tiresias, son of Everes and a nymph Chariclo, of the family of Udaeus, the Spartan, and he had lost the sight of his eyes. Different stories are told about his blindness and his power of soothsaying. For some say that he was blinded by the gods because he revealed their secrets to men. But Pherecydes says that he was blinded by Athena; for Chariclo was dear to Athena ... and Tiresias saw the goddess stark naked, and she covered his eyes with her hands, and so rendered him sightless. And when Chariclo asked her to restore his sight, she could not do so, but by cleansing his ears she caused him to understand every note of birds; and she gave him a staff of cornel-wood, wherewith he walked like those who see. But Hesiod says that he beheld snakes copulating on Cyllene, and that having wounded them he was turned from a man into a woman, but that on observing the same snakes copulating again, he became a man. Hence, when Hera and Zeus disputed whether the pleasures of love are felt more by women or by men, they referred to him for a decision. He said that if the pleasures of love be reckoned at ten, men enjoy one and women nine. Wherefore Hera blinded him, but Zeus bestowed on him the art of soothsaying.” The saying of Tiresias to Zeus and Hera.
Of ten parts a man enjoys one only;
But a woman enjoys the full ten parts in her heart.
 “ He also lived to a great age.So when the Thebans sought counsel of him, he said that they should be victorious if Menoeceus, son of Creon, would offer himself freely as a sacrifice to Ares. On hearing that, Menoeceus, son of Creon, slew himself before the gates. But a battle having taken place, the Cadmeans were chased in a crowd as far as the walls, and Capaneus, seizing a ladder, was climbing up it to the walls, when Zeus smote him with a thunderbolt.

[8] τούτου δὲ γενομένου τροπὴ τῶν Ἀργείων γίνεται. ὡς δὲ ἀπώλλυντο πολλοί, δόξαν ἑκατέροις τοῖς στρατεύμασιν Ἐτεοκλῆς καὶ Πολυνείκης περὶ τῆς βασιλείας μονομαχοῦσι, καὶ κτείνουσιν ἀλλήλους. καρτερᾶς δὲ πάλιν γενομένης μάχης οἱ Ἀστακοῦ παῖδες ἠρίστευσαν: Ἴσμαρος μὲν γὰρ Ἱππομέδοντα ἀπέκτεινε, Λεάδης δὲ Ἐτέοκλον, Ἀμφίδικος δὲ Παρθενοπαῖον. ὡς δὲ Εὐριπίδης φησί, Παρθενοπαῖον ὁ Ποσειδῶνος παῖς Περικλύμενος ἀπέκτεινε. Μελάνιππος δὲ ὁ λοιπὸς τῶν Ἀστακοῦ παίδων εἰς τὴν γαστέρα Τυδέα τιτρώσκει. ἡμιθνῆτος δὲ αὐτοῦ κειμένου παρὰ Διὸς αἰτησαμένη Ἀθηνᾶ φάρμακον ἤνεγκε, δι᾽ οὗ ποιεῖν ἔμελλεν ἀθάνατον αὐτόν. Ἀμφιάραος δὲ αἰσθόμενος τοῦτο, μισῶν Τυδέα ὅτι παρὰ τὴν ἐκείνου γνώμην εἰς Θήβας ἔπεισε τοὺς Ἀργείους στρατεύεσθαι, τὴν Μελανίππου κεφαλὴν ἀποτεμὼν ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ τιτρωσκόμενος δὲ Τυδεὺς ἔκτεινεν αὐτόν. ὁ δὲ διελὼν τὸν ἐγκέφαλον ἐξερρόφησεν. ὡς δὲ εἶδεν Ἀθηνᾶ, μυσαχθεῖσα τὴν εὐεργεσίαν ἐπέσχε τε καὶ ἐφθόνησεν. Ἀμφιαράῳ δὲ φεύγοντι παρὰ ποταμὸν Ἰσμηνόν, πρὶν ὑπὸ Περικλυμένου τὰ νῶτα τρωθῇ, Ζεὺς κεραυνὸν βαλὼν τὴν γῆν διέστησεν. ὁ δὲ σὺν τῷ ἅρματι καὶ τῷ ἡνιόχῳ Βάτωνι, ὡς δὲ ἔνιοι Ἐλάτωνι, ἐκρύφθη, καὶ Ζεὺς ἀθάνατον αὐτὸν ἐποίησεν. Ἄδραστον δὲ μόνον ἵππος διέσωσεν Ἀρείων: τοῦτον ἐκ Ποσειδῶνος ἐγέννησε Δημήτηρ εἰκασθεῖσα ἐρινύι κατὰ τὴν συνουσίαν.

[8] When that befell, the Argives turned to flee. And as many fell, Eteocles and Polynices, by the resolution of both armies, fought a single combat for the kingdom, and slew each other. In another fierce battle the sons of Astacus did doughty deeds; for Ismarus slew Hippomedon, Leades slew Eteoclus, and Amphidicus slew Parthenopaeus. But Euripides says that Parthenopaeus was slain by Periclymenus, son of Poseidon. And Melanippus, the remaining one of the sons of Astacus, wounded Tydeus in the belly. As he lay half dead, Athena brought a medicine which she had begged of Zeus, and by which she intended to make him immortal. But Amphiaraus hated Tydeus for thwarting him by persuading the Argives to march to Thebes; so when he perceived the intention of the goddess he cut off the head of Melanippus and gave it to Tydeus, who, wounded though he was, had killed him. And Tydeus split open the head and gulped up the brains. But when Athena saw that, in disgust she grudged and withheld the intended benefit. Amphiaraus fled beside the river Ismenus, and before Periclymenus could wound him in the back, Zeus cleft the earth by throwing a thunderbolt, and Amphiaraus vanished with his chariot and his charioteer Baton, or, as some say, Elato; and Zeus made him immortal. Adrastus alone was saved by his horse Arion. That horse Poseidon begot on Demeter, when in the likeness of a Fury she consorted with him.

[1] Κρέων δὲ τὴν Θηβαίων βασιλείαν παραλαβὼν τοὺς τῶν Ἀργείων νεκροὺς ἔρριψεν ἀτάφους, καὶ κηρύξας μηδένα θάπτειν φύλακας κατέστησεν. Ἀντιγόνη δέ, μία τῶν Οἰδίποδος θυγατέρων, κρύφα τὸ Πολυνείκους σῶμα κλέψασα ἔθαψε, καὶ φωραθεῖσα ὑπὸ Κρέοντος αὐτοῦ τῷ τάφῳ ζῶσα ἐνεκρύφθη. Ἄδραστος δὲ εἰς Ἀθήνας ἀφικόμενος ἐπὶ τὸν ἐλέου βωμὸν κατέφυγε, καὶ ἱκετηρίαν θεὶς ἠξίου θάπτειν τοὺς νεκρούς. οἱ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι μετὰ Θησέως στρατεύσαντες αἱροῦσι Θήβας καὶ τοὺς νεκροὺς τοῖς οἰκείοις διδόασι θάψαι. τῆς Καπανέως δὲ καιομένης πυρᾶς, Εὐάδνη, ἡ Καπανέως μὲν γυνὴ θυγάτηρ δὲ Ἴφιος, ἑαυτὴν ἐμβαλοῦσα συγκατεκαίετο.

[1] Having succeeded to the kingdom of Thebes, Creon cast out the Argive dead unburied, issued a proclamation that none should bury them, and set watchmen. But Antigone, one of the daughters of Oedipus, stole the body of Polynices, and secretly buried it, and having been detected by Creon himself, she was interred alive in the grave. Adrastus fled to Athens and took refuge at the altar of Mercy, and laying on it the suppliant’s bough he prayed that they would bury the dead. And the Athenians marched with Theseus, captured Thebes, and gave the dead to their kinsfolk to bury. And when the pyre of Capaneus was burning, his wife Evadne, the daughter of Iphis, thew herself on the pyre, and was burned with him.

[2] μετὰ δὲ ἔτη δέκα οἱ τῶν ἀπολομένων παῖδες, κληθέντες ἐπίγονοι, στρατεύειν ἐπὶ Θήβας προῃροῦντο, τὸν τῶν πατέρων θάνατον τιμωρήσασθαι βουλόμενοι. καὶ μαντευομένοις αὐτοῖς ὁ θεὸς ἐθέσπισε νίκην Ἀλκμαίωνος ἡγουμένου. ὁ μὲν οὖν Ἀλκμαίων ἡγεῖσθαι τῆς στρατείας οὐ βουλόμενος πρὶν τίσασθαι τὴν μητέρα, ὅμως στρατεύεται: λαβοῦσα γὰρ Ἐριφύλη παρὰ Θερσάνδρου τοῦ Πολυνείκους τὸν πέπλον συνέπεισε καὶ τοὺς παῖδας στρατεύεσθαι. οἱ δὲ ἡγεμόνα Ἀλκμαίωνα ἑλόμενοι Θήβας ἐπολέμουν. ἦσαν δὲ οἱ στρατευόμενοι οἵδε: Ἀλκμαίων καὶ Ἀμφίλοχος Ἀμφιαράου, Αἰγιαλεὺς Ἀδράστου, Διομήδης Τυδέως, Πρόμαχος Παρθενοπαίου, Σθένελος Καπανέως, Θέρσανδρος Πολυνείκους, Εὐρύαλος Μηκιστέως.

[2] Ten years afterwards the sons of the fallen, called the Epigoni, purposed to march against Thebes to avenge the death of their fathers; and when they consulted the oracle, the god predicted victory under the leadership of Alcmaeon. So Alcmaeon joined the expedition, though he was loath to lead the army till he had punished his mother; for Eriphyle had received the robe from Thersander, son of Polynices, and had persuaded her sons also to go to the war. Having chosen Alcmaeon as their leader, they made war on Thebes. The men who took part in the expedition were these: Alcmaeon and Amphilochus, sons of Amphiaraus; Aegialeus, son of Adrastus; Diomedes, son of Tydeus; Promachus, son of Parthenopaeus; Sthenelus, son of Capaneus; Thersander, son of Polynices; and Euryalus, son of Mecisteus.

[3] οὗτοι πρῶτον μὲν πορθοῦσι τὰς πέριξ κώμας, ἔπειτα τῶν Θηβαίων ἐπελθόντων Λαοδάμαντος τοῦ Ἐτεοκλέους ἡγουμένου γενναίως μάχονται. καὶ Λαοδάμας μὲν Αἰγιαλέα κτείνει, Λαοδάμαντα δὲ Ἀλκμαίων. καὶ μετὰ τὸν τούτου θάνατον Θηβαῖοι συμφεύγουσιν εἰς τὰ τείχη. Τειρεσίου δὲ εἰπόντος αὐτοῖς πρὸς μὲν Ἀργείους κήρυκα περὶ διαλύσεως ἀποστέλλειν, αὐτοὺς δὲ φεύγειν, πρὸς μὲν τοὺς πολεμίους κήρυκα πέμπουσιν, αὐτοὶ δὲ ἀναβιβάσαντες ἐπὶ τὰς ἀπήνας τέκνα καὶ γυναῖκας ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ἔφευγον. νύκτωρ δὲ ἐπὶ τὴν λεγομένην Τιλφοῦσσαν κρήνην παραγενομένων αὐτῶν, Τειρεσίας ἀπὸ ταύτης πιὼν αὐτοῦ τὸν βίον κατέστρεψε. Θηβαῖοι δὲ ἐπὶ πολὺ διελθόντες πόλιν Ἑστιαίαν κτίσαντες κατῴκησαν.

[3] They first laid waste the surrounding villages; then, when the Thebans advanced against them, led by Laodamas, son of Eteocles, they fought bravely, and though Laodamas killed Aegialeus, he was himself killed by Alcmaeon, and after his death the Thebans fled in a body within the walls. But as Tiresias told them to send a herald to treat with the Argives, and themselves to take to flight, they did send a herald to the enemy, and, mounting their children and women on the wagons, themselves fled from the city. When they had come by night to the spring called Tilphussa, Tiresias drank of it and expired. After travelling far the Thebans built the city of Hestiaea and took up their abode there.

[4] Ἀργεῖοι δὲ ὕστερον τὸν δρασμὸν τῶν Θηβαίων μαθόντες εἰσίασιν εἰς τὴν πόλιν, καὶ συναθροίζουσι τὴν λείαν, καὶ καθαιροῦσι τὰ τείχη. τῆς δὲ λείας μέρος εἰς Δελφοὺς πέμπουσιν Ἀπόλλωνι καὶ τὴν Τειρεσίου θυγατέρα Μαντώ: ηὔξαντο γὰρ αὐτῷ Θήβας ἑλόντες τὸ κάλλιστον τῶν λαφύρων ἀναθήσειν.

[4] But the Argives, on learning afterwards the flight of the Thebans, entered the city and collected the booty, and pulled down the walls. But they sent a portion of the booty to Apollo at Delphi and with it Manto, daughter of Tiresias; for they had vowed that, if they took Thebes, they would dedicate to him the fairest of the spoils.

[5] μετὰ δὲ τὴν Θηβῶν ἅλωσιν αἰσθόμενος Ἀλκμαίων καὶ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ δῶρα εἰληφυῖαν Ἐριφύλην τὴν μητέρα μᾶλλον ἠγανάκτησε, καὶ χρήσαντος Ἀπόλλωνος αὐτῷ τὴν μητέρα ἀπέκτεινεν. ἔνιοι μὲν λέγουσι σὺν Ἀμφιλόχῳ τῷ ἀδελφῷ κτεῖναι τὴν Ἐριφύλην, ἔνιοι δὲ ὅτι μόνος. Ἀλκμαίωνα δὲ μετῆλθεν ἐρινὺς τοῦ μητρῴου φόνου, καὶ μεμηνὼς πρῶτον μὲν εἰς Ἀρκαδίαν πρὸς Ὀικλέα παραγίνεται, ἐκεῖθεν δὲ εἰς Ψωφῖδα πρὸς Φηγέα. καθαρθεὶς δὲ ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ Ἀρσινόην γαμεῖ τὴν τούτου θυγατέρα, καὶ τόν τε ὅρμον καὶ τὸν πέπλον ἔδωκε ταύτῃ. γενομένης δὲ ὕστερον τῆς γῆς δι᾽ αὐτὸν ἀφόρου, χρήσαντος αὐτῷ τοῦ θεοῦ πρὸς Ἀχελῷον ἀπιέναι καὶ παρ᾽ ἐκεῖνον παλινδικίαν λαμβάνειν, τὸ μὲν πρῶτον πρὸς Οἰνέα παραγίνεται εἰς Καλυδῶνα καὶ ξενίζεται παρ᾽ αὐτῷ, ἔπειτα ἀφικόμενος εἰς Θεσπρωτοὺς τῆς χώρας ἀπελαύνεται. τελευταῖον δὲ ἐπὶ τὰς Ἀχελῴου πηγὰς παραγενόμενος καθαίρεταί τε ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν ἐκείνου θυγατέρα Καλλιρρόην λαμβάνει, καὶ ὃν Ἀχελῷος προσέχωσε τόπον κτίσας κατῴκησε. Καλλιρρόης δὲ ὕστερον τόν τε ὅρμον καὶ τὸν πέπλον ἐπιθυμούσης λαβεῖν, καὶ λεγούσης οὐ συνοικήσειν αὐτῷ εἰ μὴ λάβοι ταῦτα, παραγενόμενος εἰς Ψωφῖδα Ἀλκμαίων Φηγεῖ λέγει τεθεσπίσθαι τῆς μανίας ἀπαλλαγὴν ἑαυτῷ, τὸν ὅρμον ὅταν εἰς Δελφοὺς κομίσας ἀναθῇ καὶ τὸν πέπλον. ὁ δὲ πιστεύσας δίδωσι μηνύσαντος δὲ θεράποντος ὅτι Καλλιρρόῃ ταῦτα λαβὼν ἐκόμιζεν, ἐνεδρευθεὶς ὑπὸ τῶν Φηγέως παίδων ἐπιτάξαντος τοῦ Φηγέως ἀναιρεῖται. Ἀρσινόην δὲ μεμφομένην οἱ τοῦ Φηγέως παῖδες ἐμβιβάσαντες εἰς λάρνακα κομίζουσιν εἰς Τεγέαν καὶ διδόασι δούλην Ἀγαπήνορι, καταψευσάμενοι αὐτῆς τὸν Ἀλκμαίωνος φόνον.

[5] After the capture of Thebes, when Alcmaeon learned that his mother Eriphyle had been bribed to his undoing also, he was more incensed than ever, and in accordance with an oracle given to him by Apollo he killed his mother. Some say that he killed her in conjunction with his brother Amphilochus, others that he did it alone. But Alcmaeon was visited by the Fury of his mother’s murder, and going mad he first repaired to Oicles in Arcadia, and thence to Phegeus at Psophis. And having been purified by him he married Arsinoe, daughter of Phegeus, and gave her the necklace and the robe. But afterwards the ground became barren on his account, and the god bade him in an oracle to depart to Achelous and to stand another trial on the river bank. At first he repaired to Oeneus at Calydon and was entertained by him; then he went to the Thesprotians, but was driven away from the country; and finally he went to the springs of Achelous, and was purified by him, and received Callirrhoe, his daughter, to wife. Moreover he colonized the land which the Achelous had formed by its silt, and he took up his abode there. But afterwards Callirrhoe coveted the necklace and robe, and said she would not live with him if she did not get them. So away Alcmaeon hied to Psophis and told Phegeus how it had been predicted that he should be rid of his madness when he had brought the necklace and the robe to Delphi and dedicated them. Phegeus believed him and gave them to him. But a servant having let out that he was taking the things to Callirrhoe, Phegeus commanded his sons, and they lay in wait and killed him. When Arsinoe upbraided them, the sons of Phegeus clapped her into a chest and carried her to Tegea and gave her as a slave to Agapenor, falsely accusing her of Alcmaeon’s murder.

[6] Καλλιρρόη δὲ τὴν Ἀλκμαίωνος ἀπώλειαν μαθοῦσα, πλησιάζοντος αὐτῇ τοῦ Διός, αἰτεῖται τοὺς γεγεννημένους παῖδας ἐξ Ἀλκμαίωνος αὐτῇ γενέσθαι τελείους, ἵνα τὸν τοῦ πατρὸς τίσωνται φόνον. γενόμενοι δὲ ἐξαίφνης οἱ παῖδες τέλειοι ἐπὶ τὴν ἐκδικίαν τοῦ πατρὸς ἐξῄεσαν. κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν δὲ καιρὸν οἵ τε Φηγέως παῖδες Πρόνοος καὶ Ἀγήνωρ, εἰς Δελφοὺς κομίζοντες ἀναθεῖναι τὸν ὅρμον καὶ τὸν πέπλον, καταλύουσι πρὸς Ἀγαπήνορα, καὶ οἱ τοῦ Ἀλκμαίωνος παῖδες Ἀμφότερός τε καὶ Ἀκαρνάν: καὶ ἀνελόντες τοὺς τοῦ πατρὸς φονέας, παραγενόμενοί τε εἰς Ψωφῖδα καὶ παρελθόντες εἰς τὰ βασίλεια τόν τε Φηγέα καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ κτείνουσι. διωχθέντες δὲ ἄχρι Τεγέας ἐπιβοηθησάντων Τεγεατῶν καί τινων Ἀργείων ἐσώθησαν, εἰς φυγὴν τῶν Ψωφιδίων τραπέντων.

[6] Being apprized of Alcmaeon’s untimely end and courted by Zeus, Callirrhoe requested that the sons she had by Alcmaeon might be full grown in order to avenge their father’s murder. And being suddenly full-grown, the sons went forth to right their father’s wrong. Now Pronous and Agenor, the sons of Phegeus, carrying the necklace and robe to Delphi to dedicate them, turned in at the house of Agapenor at the same time as Amphoterus and Acarnan, the sons of Alcmaeon; and the sons of Alcmaeon killed their father’s murderers, and going to Psophis and entering the palace they slew both Phegeus and his wife. They were pursued as far as Tegea, but saved by the intervention of the Tegeans and some Argives, and the Psophidians took to flight.

[7] δηλώσαντες δὲ τῇ μητρὶ ταῦτα, τόν τε ὅρμον καὶ τὸν πέπλον ἐλθόντες εἰς Δελφοὺς ἀνέθεντο κατὰ πρόσταξιν Ἀχελῴου. πορευθέντες δὲ εἰς τὴν Ἤπειρον συναθροίζουσιν οἰκήτορας καὶ κτίζουσιν Ἀκαρνανίαν.Εὐριπίδης δέ φησιν Ἀλκμαίωνα κατὰ τὸν τῆς μανίας χρόνον ἐκ Μαντοῦς Τειρεσίου παῖδας δύο γεννῆσαι, Ἀμφίλοχον καὶ θυγατέρα Τισιφόνην, κομίσαντα δὲ εἰς Κόρινθον τὰ βρέφη δοῦναι τρέφειν Κορινθίων βασιλεῖ Κρέοντι, καὶ τὴν μὲν Τισιφόνην διενεγκοῦσαν εὐμορφίᾳ ὑπὸ τῆς Κρέοντος γυναικὸς ἀπεμποληθῆναι, δεδοικυίας μὴ Κρέων αὐτὴν γαμετὴν ποιήσηται. τὸν δὲ Ἀλκμαίωνα ἀγοράσαντα ταύτην ἔχειν οὐκ εἰδότα τὴν ἑαυτοῦ θυγατέρα θεράπαιναν, παραγενόμενον δὲ εἰς Κόρινθον ἐπὶ τὴν τῶν τέκνων ἀπαίτησιν καὶ τὸν υἱὸν κομίσασθαι. καὶ Ἀμφίλοχος κατὰ χρησμοὺς Ἀπόλλωνος Ἀμφιλοχικὸν Ἄργος ᾤκισεν.

[7] Having acquainted their mother with these things, they went to Delphi and dedicated the necklace and robe according to the injunction of Achelous. Then they journeyed to Epirus, collected settlers, and colonized Acarnania.But Euripides says that in the time of his madness Alcmaeon begat two children, Amphilochus and a daughter Tisiphone, by Manto, daughter of Tiresias, and that he brought the babes to Corinth and gave them to Creon, king of Corinth, to bring up; and that on account of her extraordinary comeliness Tisiphone was sold as a slave by Creon’s spouse, who feared that Creon might make her his wedded wife. But Alcmaeon bought her and kept her as a handmaid, not knowing that she was his daughter, and coming to Corinth to get back his children he recovered his son also. And Amphilochus colonized Amphilochian Argos in obedience to oracles of Apollo.

[1] ἐπανάγωμεν δὲ νῦν πάλιν ἐπὶ τὸν Πελασγόν, ὃν Ἀκουσίλαος μὲν Διὸς λέγει καὶ Νιόβης, καθάπερ ὑπέθεμεν, Ἡσίοδος δὲ αὐτόχθονα. τούτου καὶ τῆς Ὠκεανοῦ θυγατρὸς Μελιβοίας, ἢ καθάπερ ἄλλοι λέγουσι νύμφης Κυλλήνης, παῖς Λυκάων ἐγένετο, ὃς βασιλεύων Ἀρκάδων ἐκ πολλῶν γυναικῶν πεντήκοντα παῖδας ἐγέννησε: Μελαινέα Θεσπρωτὸν Ἕλικα Νύκτιμον Πευκέτιον, Καύκωνα Μηκιστέα Ὁπλέα Μακαρέα Μάκεδνον, Ὅρον Πόλιχον Ἀκόντην Εὐαίμονα Ἀγκύορα, Ἀρχεβάτην Καρτέρωνα Αἰγαίωνα Πάλλαντα Εὔμονα, Κάνηθον Πρόθοον Λίνον Κορέθοντα Μαίναλον, Τηλεβόαν Φύσιον Φάσσον Φθῖον Λύκιον, Ἁλίφηρον Γενέτορα Βουκολίωνα Σωκλέα Φινέα, Εὐμήτην Ἁρπαλέα Πορθέα Πλάτωνα Αἵμονα, Κύναιθον Λέοντα Ἁρπάλυκον Ἡραιέα Τιτάναν, Μαντινέα Κλείτορα Στύμφαλον Ὀρχομενόν ... οὗτοι πάντας ἀνθρώπους ὑπερέβαλλον ὑπερηφανίᾳ καὶ ἀσεβείᾳ. Ζεὺς δὲ αὐτῶν βουλόμενος τὴν ἀσέβειαν πειρᾶσαι εἰκασθεὶς ἀνδρὶ χερνήτῃ παραγίνεται. οἱ δὲ αὐτὸν ἐπὶ ξένια καλέσαντες, σφάξαντες ἕνα τῶν ἐπιχωρίων παῖδα, τοῖς ἱεροῖς τὰ τούτου σπλάγχνα συναναμίξαντες παρέθεσαν, συμβουλεύσαντος τοῦ πρεσβυτέρου ἀδελφοῦ Μαινάλου. Ζεὺς δὲ μυσαχθεὶς τὴν μὲν τράπεζαν ἀνέτρεψεν, ἔνθα νῦν Τραπεζοῦς καλεῖται ὁ τόπος, Λυκάονα δὲ καὶ τοὺς τούτου παῖδας ἐκεραύνωσε, χωρὶς τοῦ νεωτάτου Νυκτίμου: φθάσασα γὰρ ἡ Γῆ καὶ τῆς δεξιᾶς τοῦ Διὸς ἐφαψαμένη τὴν ὀργὴν κατέπαυσε.

[1] Let us now return to Pelasgus, who, Acusilaus says, was a son of Zeus and Niobe, as we have supposed, but Hesiod declares him to have been a son of the soil. He had a son Lycaon by Meliboea, daughter of Ocean or, as others say, by a nymph Cyllene; and Lycaon, reigning over the Arcadians, begat by many wives fifty sons, to wit: Melaeneus, Thesprotus, Helix, Nyctimus, Peucetius, Caucon, Mecisteus, Hopleus, Macareus, Macednus, Horus, Polichus, Acontes, Evaemon, Ancyor, Archebates, Carteron, Aegaeon, Pallas, Eumon, Canethus, Prothous, Linus, Coretho, Maenalus, Teleboas, Physius, Phassus, Phthius, Lycius, Halipherus, Genetor, Bucolion, Socleus, Phineus, Eumetes, Harpaleus, Portheus, Plato, Haemo, Cynaethus, Leo, Harpalycus, Heraeeus, Titanas, Mantineus, Clitor, Stymphalus, Orchomenus, ... These exceeded all men in pride and impiety; and Zeus, desirous of putting their impiety to the proof, came to them in the likeness of a day-laborer. They offered him hospitality and having slaughtered a male child of the natives, they mixed his bowels with the sacrifices, and set them before him, at the instigation of the elder brother Maenalus. But Zeus in disgust upset the table at the place which is still called Trapezus, and blasted Lycaon and his sons by thunderbolts, all but Nyctimus, the youngest; for Earth was quick enough to lay hold of the right hand of Zeus and so appease his wrath.

[2] Νυκτίμου δὲ. τὴν βασιλείαν παραλαβόντος ὁ ἐπὶ Δευκαλίωνος κατακλυσμὸς ἐγένετο. τοῦτον ἔνιοι διὰ τὴν τῶν Λυκάονος παίδων δυσσέβειαν εἶπον γεγενῆσθαι.Εὔμηλος δὲ καί τινες ἕτεροι λέγουσι Λυκάονι καὶ θυγατέρα Καλλιστὼ γενέσθαι: Ἡσίοδος μὲν γὰρ αὐτὴν μίαν εἶναι τῶν νυμφῶν λέγει, Ἄσιος δὲ Νυκτέως, Φερεκύδης δὲ Κητέως. αὕτη σύνθηρος Ἀρτέμιδος οὖσα, τὴν αὐτὴν ἐκείνῃ στολὴν φοροῦσα, ὤμοσεν αὐτῇ μεῖναι παρθένος. Ζεὺς δὲ ἐρασθεὶς ἀκούσῃ συνευνάζεται, εἰκασθείς, ὡς μὲν ἔνιοι λέγουσιν, Ἀρτέμιδι, ὡς δὲ ἔνιοι, Ἀπόλλωνι. βουλόμενος δὲ Ἥραν λαθεῖν εἰς ἄρκτον μετεμόρφωσεν αὐτήν. Ἥρα δὲ ἔπεισεν Ἄρτεμιν ὡς ἄγριον θηρίον κατατοξεῦσαι. εἰσὶ δὲ οἱ λέγοντες ὡς Ἄρτεμις αὐτὴν κατετόξευσεν ὅτι τὴν παρθενίαν οὐκ ἐφύλαξεν. ἀπολομένης δὲ Καλλιστοῦς Ζεὺς τὸ βρέφος ἁρπάσας ἐν Ἀρκαδίᾳ δίδωσιν ἀνατρέφειν Μαίᾳ, προσαγορεύσας Ἀρκάδα: τὴν δὲ Καλλιστὼ καταστερίσας ἐκάλεσεν ἄρκτον.

[2] But when Nyctimus succeeded to the kingdom, there occurred the flood in the age of Deucalion; some said that it was occasioned by the impiety of Lycaon’s sons.But Eumelus and some others say that Lycaon had also a daughter Callisto; though Hesiod says she was one of the nymphs, Asius that she was a daughter of Nycteus, and Pherecydes that she was a daughter of Ceteus. She was a companion of Artemis in the chase, wore the same garb, and swore to her to remain a maid. Now Zeus loved her and, having assumed the likeness, as some say, of Artemis, or, as others say, of Apollo, he shared her bed against her will, and wishing to escape the notice of Hera, he turned her into a bear. But Hera persuaded Artemis to shoot her down as a wild beast. Some say, however, that Artemis shot her down because she did not keep her maidenhood. When Callisto perished, Zeus snatched the babe, named it Arcas, and gave it to Maia to bring up in Arcadia; and Callisto he turned into a star and called it the Bear.

[1] Ἀρκάδος δὲ καὶ Λεανείρας τῆς Ἀμύκλου ἢ Μεγανείρας τῆς Κρόκωνος, ὡς δὲ Εὔμηλος λέγει, νύμφης Χρυσοπελείας, ἐγένοντο παῖδες Ἔλατος καὶ Ἀφείδας. οὗτοι τὴν γῆν ἐμερίσαντο, τὸ δὲ πᾶν κράτος εἶχεν Ἔλατος, ὃς ἐκ Λαοδίκης τῆς Κινύρου Στύμφαλον καὶ Περέα τεκνοῖ, Ἀφείδας δὲ Ἀλεὸν καὶ Σθενέβοιαν, ἣν γαμεῖ Προῖτος. Ἀλεοῦ δὲ καὶ Νεαίρας τῆς Περέως θυγάτηρ μὲν Αὔγη, υἱοὶ δὲ Κηφεὺς καὶ Λυκοῦργος. Αὔγη μὲν οὖν ὑφ᾽ Ἡρακλέους φθαρεῖσα κατέκρυψε τὸ βρέφος ἐν τῷ τεμένει τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς, ἧς εἶχε τὴν ἱερωσύνην. ἀκάρπου δὲ τῆς γῆς μενούσης, καὶ μηνυόντων τῶν χρησμῶν εἶναί τι ἐν τῷ τεμένει τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς δυσσέβημα, φωραθεῖσα ὑπὸ τοῦ πατρὸς παρεδόθη Ναυπλίῳ ἐπὶ θανάτῳ παρ᾽ οὗ Τεύθρας ὁ Μυσῶν δυνάστης παραλαβὼν αὐτὴν ἔγημε. τὸ δὲ βρέφος ἐκτεθὲν ἐν ὄρει Παρθενίῳ θηλὴν ὑποσχούσης ἐλάφου Τήλεφος ἐκλήθη, καὶ τραφεὶς ὑπὸ τῶν Κορύθου βουκόλων καὶ ζητήσας τοὺς γονέας ἧκεν εἰς Δελφούς, καὶ μαθὼν παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ, παραγενόμενος εἰς Μυσίαν θετὸς παῖς Τεύθραντος γίνεται: καὶ τελευτῶντος αὐτοῦ διάδοχος τῆς δυναστείας γίνεται.

[1] Arcas had two sons, Elatus and Aphidas, by Leanira, daughter of Amyclas, or by Meganira, daughter of Croco, or, according to Eumelus, by a nymph Chrysopelia. These divided the land between them, but Elatus had all the power, and he begat Stymphalus and Pereus by Laodice, daughter of Cinyras, and Aphidas had a son Aleus and a daughter Stheneboea, who was married to Proetus. And Aleus had a daughter Auge and two sons, Cepheus and Lycurgus, by Neaera, daughter of Pereus. Auge was seduced by Hercules and hid her babe in the precinct of Athena, whose priesthood she held. But the land remaining barren, and the oracles declaring that there was impiety in the precinct of Athena, she was detected and delivered by her father to Nauplius to be put to death, and from him Teuthras, prince of Mysia, received and married her. But the babe, being exposed on Mount Parthenius, was suckled by a doe and hence called Telephus. Bred by the neatheards of Corythus, he went to Delphi in quest of his parents, and on information received from the god he repaired to Mysia and became an adopted son of Teuthras, on whose death he succeeded to the princedom.

[2] Λυκούργου δὲ καὶ Κλεοφύλης ἢ Εὐρυνόμης Ἀγκαῖος καὶ Ἔποχος καὶ Ἀμφιδάμας καὶ Ἴασος. Ἀμφιδάμαντος δὲ Μελανίων καὶ θυγάτηρ Ἀντιμάχη, ἣν Εὐρυσθεὺς ἔγημεν. Ἰάσου δὲ καὶ Κλυμένης τῆς Μινύου Ἀταλάντη ἐγένετο. ταύτης ὁ πατὴρ ἀρρένων παίδων ἐπιθυμῶν ἐξέθηκεν αὐτήν, ἄρκτος δὲ φοιτῶσα πολλάκις θηλὴν ἐδίδου, μέχρις οὗ εὑρόντες κυνηγοὶ παρ᾽ ἑαυτοῖς ἀνέτρεφον. τελεία δὲ Ἀταλάντη γενομένη παρθένον ἑαυτὴν ἐφύλαττε, καὶ θηρεύουσα ἐν ἐρημίᾳ καθωπλισμένη διετέλει. βιάζεσθαι δὲ αὐτὴν ἐπιχειροῦντες Κένταυροι Ῥοῖκός τε καὶ Ὑλαῖος κατατοξευθέντες ὑπ᾽ αὐτῆς ἀπέθανον. παρεγένετο δὲ μετὰ τῶν ἀριστέων καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν Καλυδώνιον κάπρον, καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐπὶ Πελίᾳ τεθέντι ἀγῶνι ἐπάλαισε Πηλεῖ καὶ ἐνίκησεν. ἀνευροῦσα δὲ ὕστερον τοὺς γονέας, ὡς ὁ πατὴρ γαμεῖν αὐτὴν ἔπειθεν ἀπιοῦσα εἰς σταδιαῖον τόπον καὶ πήξασα μέσον σκόλοπα τρίπηχυν, ἐντεῦθεν τῶν μνηστευομένων τοὺς δρόμους προϊεῖσα ἐτρόχαζε καθωπλισμένη: καὶ καταληφθέντι μὲν αὐτοῦ θάνατος ὠφείλετο, μὴ καταληφθέντι δὲ γάμος. ἤδη δὲ πολλῶν ἀπολομένων Μελανίων αὐτῆς ἐρασθεὶς ἧκεν ἐπὶ τὸν δρόμον, χρύσεα μῆλα κομίζων παρ᾽ Ἀφροδίτης, καὶ διωκόμενος ταῦτα ἔρριπτεν. ἡ δὲ ἀναιρουμένη τὰ ῥιπτόμενα τὸν δρόμον ἐνικήθη. ἔγημεν οὖν αὐτὴν Μελανίων. καί ποτε λέγεται θηρεύοντας αὐτοὺς εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὸ τέμενος Διός, κἀκεῖ συνουσιάζοντας εἰς λέοντας ἀλλαγῆναι. Ἡσίοδος δὲ καί τινες ἕτεροι τὴν Ἀταλάντην οὐκ Ἰάσου ἀλλὰ Σχοινέως εἶπον, Εὐριπίδης δὲ Μαινάλου, καὶ τὸν γήμαντα αὐτὴν οὐ Μελανίωνα ἀλλὰ Ἱππομένην. ἐγέννησε δὲ ἐκ Μελανίωνος Ἀταλάντη ἢ Ἄρεος Παρθενοπαῖον, ὃς ἐπὶ Θήβας ἐστρατεύσατο.

[2] Lycurgus had sons, Ancaeus, Epochus, Amphidamas, and Iasus, by Cleophyle or Eurynome. And Amphidamas had a son Melanion and a daughter Antimache, whom Eurystheus married. And Iasus had a daughter Atalanta by Clymene, daughter of Minyas. This Atalanta was exposed by her father, because he desired male children; and a she bear came often and gave her suck, till hunters found her and brought her up among themselves. Grown to womanhood, Atalanta kept herself a virgin, and hunting in the wilderness she remained always under arms. The centaurs Rhoecus and Hylaeus tried to force her, but were shot down and killed by her. She went moreover with the chiefs to hunt the Calydonian boar, and at the games held in honor of Pelias she wrestled with Peleus and won. Afterwards she discovered her parents, but when her father would have persuaded her to wed, she went away to a place that might serve as a racecourse, and, having planted a stake three cubits high in the middle of it, she caused her wooers to race before her from there, and ran herself in arms; and if the wooer was caught up, his due was death on the spot, and if he was not caught up, his due was marriage. When many had already perished, Melanion came to run for love of her, bringing golden apples from Aphrodite, and being pursued he threw them down, and she, picking up the dropped fruit, was beaten in the race. So Melanion married her. And once on a time it is said that out hunting they entered into the precinct of Zeus, and there taking their fill of love were changed into lions. But Hesiod and some others have said that Atalanta was not a daughter of Iasus, but of Schoeneus; and Euripides says that she was a daughter of Maenalus, and that her husband was not Melanion but Hippomenes. And by Melanion, or Ares, Atalanta had a son Parthenopaeus, who went to the war against Thebes.

[1] Ἄτλαντος δὲ καὶ τῆς Ὠκεανοῦ Πληιόνης ἐγένοντο θυγατέρες ἑπτὰ ἐν Κυλλήνῃ τῆς Ἀρκαδίας, αἱ Πληιάδες προσαγορευθεῖσαι, Ἀλκυόνη Μερόπη Κελαινὼ Ἠλέκτρα Στερόπη Ταϋγέτη Μαῖα. τούτων Στερόπην μὲν Οἰνόμαος ἔγημε, Σίσυφος δὲ Μερόπην. δυσὶ δὲ ἐμίχθη Ποσειδῶν, πρώτῃ μὲν Κελαινοῖ, ἐξ ἧς Λύκος ἔγεντο, ὃν Ποσειδῶν ἐν μακάρων ᾤκισε νήσοις, δευτέρᾳ δὲ Ἀλκυόνῃ, ἣ θυγατέρα μὲν ἐτέκνωσεν Αἴθουσαν τὴν Ἀπόλλωνι Ἐλευθῆρα τεκοῦσαν, υἱοὺς δὲ Ὑριέα καὶ Ὑπερήνορα.

[1] Atlas and Pleione, daughter of Ocean, had seven daughters called the Pleiades, born to them at Cyllene in Arcadia, to wit: Alcyone, Merope, Celaeno, Electra, Sterope, Taygete, and Maia. Of these, Sterope was married to Oenomaus, and Merope to Sisyphus. And Poseidon had intercourse with two of them, first with Celaeno, by whom he had Lycus, whom Poseidon made to dwell in the Islands of the Blest, and second with Alcyone, who bore a daughter, Aethusa, the mother of Eleuther by Apollo, and two sons Hyrieus and Hyperenor. Hyrieus had Nycteus and Lycus by a nymph Clonia; and Nycteus had Antiope by Polyxo; and Antiope had Zethus and Amphion by Zeus. And Zeus consorted with the other daughters of Atlas.

[2] Μαῖα μὲν οὖν ἡ πρεσβυτάτη Διὶ συνελθοῦσα ἐν ἄντρῳ τῆς Κυλλήνης Ἑρμῆν τίκτει. οὗτος ἐν σπαργάνοις ἐπὶ τοῦ λίκνου κείμενος, ἐκδὺς εἰς Πιερίαν παραγίνεται, καὶ κλέπτει βόας ἃς ἔνεμεν Ἀπόλλων. ἵνα δὲ μὴ φωραθείη ὑπὸ τῶν ἰχνῶν, ὑποδήματα τοῖς ποσὶ περιέθηκε, καὶ κομίσας εἰς Πύλον τὰς μὲν λοιπὰς εἰς σπήλαιον ἀπέκρυψε, δύο δὲ καταθύσας τὰς μὲν βύρσας πέτραις καθήλωσε, τῶν δὲ κρεῶν τὰ μὲν κατηνάλωσεν ἑψήσας τὰ δὲ κατέκαυσε: καὶ ταχέως εἰς Κυλλήνην ᾤχετο. καὶ εὑρίσκει πρὸ τοῦ ἄντρου νεμομένην χελώνην. ταύτην ἐκκαθάρας, εἰς τὸ κύτος χορδὰς ἐντείνας ἐξ ὧν ἔθυσε βοῶν καὶ ἐργασάμενος λύραν εὗρε καὶ πλῆκτρον. Ἀπόλλων δὲ τὰς βόας ζητῶν εἰς Πύλον ἀφικνεῖται, καὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἀνέκρινεν. οἱ δὲ ἰδεῖν μὲν παῖδα ἐλαύνοντα ἔφασκον, οὐκ ἔχειν δὲ εἰπεῖν ποῖ ποτε ἠλάθησαν διὰ τὸ μὴ εὑρεῖν ἴχνος δύνασθαι. μαθὼν δὲ ἐκ τῆς μαντικῆς τὸν κεκλοφότα πρὸς Μαῖαν εἰς Κυλλήνην παραγίνεται, καὶ τὸν Ἑρμῆν ᾐτιᾶτο. ἡ δὲ ἐπέδειξεν αὐτὸν ἐν τοῖς σπαργάνοις. Ἀπόλλων δὲ αὐτὸν πρὸς Δία κομίσας τὰς βόας ἀπῄτει. Διὸς δὲ κελεύοντος ἀποδοῦναι ἠρνεῖτο. μὴ πείθων δὲ ἄγει τὸν Ἀπόλλωνα εἰς Πύλον καὶ τὰς βόας ἀποδίδωσιν. ἀκούσας δὲ τῆς λύρας ὁ Ἀπόλλων ἀντιδίδωσι τὰς βόας. Ἑρμῆς δὲ ταύτας νέμων σύριγγα πάλιν πηξάμενος ἐσύριζεν. Ἀπόλλων δὲ καὶ ταύτην βουλόμενος λαβεῖν, τὴν χρυσῆν ῥάβδον ἐδίδου ἣν ἐκέκτητο βουκολῶν. ὁ δὲ καὶ ταύτην λαβεῖν ἀντὶ τῆς σύριγγος ἤθελε καὶ τὴν μαντικὴν ἐπελθεῖν: καὶ δοὺς διδάσκεται τὴν διὰ τῶν ψήφων μαντικήν. Ζεὺς δὲ αὐτὸν κήρυκα ἑαυτοῦ καὶ θεῶν ὑποχθονίων τίθησι.

[2] Maia, the eldest, as the fruit of her intercourse with Zeus, gave birth to Hermes in a cave of Cyllene. He was laid in swaddling-bands on the winnowing fan, but he slipped out and made his way to Pieria and stole the kine which Apollo was herding. And lest he should be detected by the tracks, he put shoes on their feet and brought them to Pylus, and hid the rest in a cave; but two he sacrificed and nailed the skins to rocks, while of the flesh he boiled and ate some, and some he burned. And quickly he departed to Cyllene. And before the cave he found a tortoise browsing. He cleaned it out, strung the shell with chords made from the kine he had sacrificed, and having thus produced a lyre he invented also a plectrum. But Apollo came to Pylus in search of the kine, and he questioned the inhabitants. They said that they had seen a boy driving cattle, but could not say whither they had been driven, because they could find no track. Having discovered the thief by divination, Apollo came to Maia at Cyllene and accused Hermes. But she showed him the child in his swaddling-bands. So Apollo brought him to Zeus, and claimed the kine; and when Zeus bade him restore them, Hermes denied that he had them, but not being believed he led Apollo to Pylus and restored the kine. Howbeit, when Apollo heard the lyre, he gave the kine in exchange for it. And while Hermes pastured them, he again made himself a shepherd’s pipe and piped on it. And wishing to get the pipe also, Apollo offered to give him the golden wand which he owned while he herded cattle. But Hermes wished both to get the wand for the pipe and to acquire the art of divination. So he gave the pipe and learned the art of divining by pebbles. And Zeus appointed him herald to himself and to the infernal gods.

[3] Ταϋγέτη δὲ ἐκ Διὸς ἐγέννησε Λακεδαίμονα, ἀφ᾽ οὗ καὶ Λακεδαίμων ἡ χώρα καλεῖται. Λακεδαίμονος δὲ καὶ Σπάρτης τῆς Εὐρώτα, ὃς ἦν ἀπὸ Λέλεγος αὐτόχθονος καὶ νύμφης νηίδος Κλεοχαρείας, Ἀμύκλας καὶ Εὐρυδίκη, ἣν ἔγημεν Ἀκρίσιος. Ἀμύκλα δὲ καὶ Διομήδης τῆς Λαπίθου Κυνόρτης καὶ Ὑάκινθος. τοῦτον εἶναι τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος ἐρώμενον λέγουσιν, ὃν δίσκῳ βαλὼν ἄκων ἀπέκτεινε. Κυνόρτου δὲ Περιήρης, ὃς γαμεῖ Γοργοφόνην τὴν Περσέως, καθάπερ Στησίχορός φησι, καὶ τίκτει Τυνδάρεων Ἰκάριον Ἀφαρέα Λεύκιππον. Ἀφαρέως μὲν οὖν καὶ Ἀρήνης τῆς Οἰβάλου Λυγκεύς τε καὶ Ἴδας καὶ Πεῖσος: κατὰ πολλοὺς δὲ Ἴδας ἐκ Ποσειδῶνος λέγεται. Λυγκεὺς δὲ ὀξυδερκίᾳ διήνεγκεν, ὡς καὶ τὰ ὑπὸ γῆν θεωρεῖν. Λευκίππου δὲ θυγατέρες ἐγένοντο Ἱλάειρα καὶ Φοίβη: ταύτας ἁρπάσαντες ἔγημαν Διόσκουροι. πρὸς δὲ ταύταις Ἀρσινόην ἐγέννησε. ταύτῃ μίγνυται Ἀπόλλων, ἡ δὲ Ἀσκληπιὸν γεννᾷ. τινὲς δὲ Ἀσκληπιὸν οὐκ ἐξ Ἀρσινόης τῆς Λευκίππου λέγουσιν, ἀλλ᾽ ἐκ Κορωνίδος τῆς Φλεγύου ἐν Θεσσαλίᾳ. καί φασιν ἐρασθῆναι ταύτης Ἀπόλλωνα καὶ εὐθέως συνελθεῖν: τὴν δὲ παρὰ τὴν τοῦ πατρὸς γνώμην ἑλομένην Ἴσχυϊ τῷ Καινέως ἀδελφῷ συνοικεῖν. Ἀπόλλων δὲ τὸν μὲν ἀπαγγείλαντα κόρακα καταρᾶται, ὃν τέως λευκὸν ὄντα ἐποίησε μέλανα, αὐτὴν δὲ ἀπέκτεινε. καιομένης δὲ αὐτῆς ἁρπάσας τὸ βρέφος ἐκ τῆς πυρᾶς πρὸς Χείρωνα τὸν Κένταυρον ἤνεγκε, παρ᾽ ᾧ καὶ τὴν ἰατρικὴν καὶ τὴν κυνηγετικὴν τρεφόμενος ἐδιδάχθη. καὶ γενόμενος χειρουργικὸς καὶ τὴν τέχνην ἀσκήσας ἐπὶ πολὺ οὐ μόνον ἐκώλυέ τινας ἀποθνήσκειν, ἀλλ᾽ ἀνήγειρε καὶ τοὺς ἀποθανόντας: παρὰ γὰρ Ἀθηνᾶς λαβὼν τὸ ἐκ τῶν φλεβῶν τῆς Γοργόνος ῥυὲν αἷμα, τῷ μὲν ἐκ τῶν ἀριστερῶν ῥυέντι πρὸς φθορὰν ἀνθρώπων ἐχρῆτο, τῷ δὲ ἐκ τῶν δεξιῶν πρὸς σωτηρίαν, καὶ διὰ τούτου τοὺς τεθνηκότας ἀνήγειρεν. εὗρον δέ τινας λεγομένους ἀναστῆναι ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ, Καπανέα καὶ Λυκοῦργον, ὡς Στησίχορός φησιν ἐν Ἐριφύλῃ, Ἱππόλυτον, ὡς ὁ τὰ Ναυπακτικὰ συγγράψας λέγει, Τυνδάρεων, ὥς φησι Πανύασις, Ὑμέναιον, ὡς οἱ Ὀρφικοὶ λέγουσι, Γλαῦκον τὸν Μίνωος, ὡς Μελησαγόρας λέγει.

[3] Taygete had by Zeus a son Lacedaemon, after whom the country of Lacedaemon is called. Lacedaemon and Sparta, daughter of Eurotas （ who was a son of Lelex, a son of the soil, by a Naiad nymph Cleocharia）, had a son Amyclas and a daughter Eurydice, whom Acrisius married. Amyclas and Diomede, daughter of Lapithus, had sons, Cynortes and Hyacinth. They say that this Hyacinth was beloved of Apollo and killed by him involuntarily with the cast of a quoit. Cynortes had a son Perieres, who married Gorgophone, daughter of Perseus, as Stesichorus says, and she bore Tyndareus, Icarius, Aphareus, and Leucippus. Aphareus and Arene, daughter of Oebalus, had sons Lynceus and Idas and Pisus; but according to many, Idas is said to have been gotten by Poseidon. Lynceus excelled in sharpness of sight, so that he could even see things underground. Leucippus had daughters, Hilaira and Phoebe: these the Dioscuri carried off and married. Besides them Leucippus begat Arsinoe: with her Apollo had intercourse, and she bore Aesculapius. But some affirm that Aesculapius was not a son of Arsinoe, daughter of Leucippus, but that he was a son of Coronis, daughter of Phlegyas in Thessaly. And they say that Apollo loved her and at once consorted with her, but that she, against her father’s judgment, preferred and cohabited with Ischys, brother of Caeneus. Apollo cursed the raven that brought the tidings and made him black instead of white, as he had been before; but he killed Coronis. As she was burning, he snatched the babe from the pyre and brought it to Chiron, the centaur, by whom he was brought up and taught the arts of healing and hunting. And having become a surgeon, and carried the art to a great pitch, he not only prevented some from dying, but even raised up the dead; for he had received from Athena the blood that flowed from the veins of the Gorgon, and while he used the blood that flowed from the veins on the left side for the bane of mankind, he used the blood that flowed from the right side for salvation, and by that means he raised the dead. I found some who are reported to have been raised by him, to wit, Capaneus and Lycurgus, as Stesichorus says in the Eriphyle; Hippolytus, as the author of the Naupactica reports; Tyndareus, as Panyasis says; Hymenaeus, as the Orphics report; and Glaucus, son of Minos, as Melesagoras relates.

[4] Ζεὺς δὲ φοβηθεὶς μὴ λαβόντες ἄνθρωποι θεραπείαν παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ βοηθῶσιν ἀλλήλοις, ἐκεραύνωσεν αὐτόν. καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ὀργισθεὶς Ἀπόλλων κτείνει Κύκλωπας τοὺς τὸν κεραυνὸν Διὶ κατασκευάσαντας. Ζεὺς δὲ ἐμέλλησε ῥίπτειν αὐτὸν εἰς Τάρταρον, δεηθείσης δὲ Λητοῦς ἐκέλευσεν αὐτὸν ἐνιαυτὸν ἀνδρὶ θητεῦσαι. ὁ δὲ παραγενόμενος εἰς Φερὰς πρὸς Ἄδμητον τὸν Φέρητος τούτῳ λατρεύων ἐποίμαινε, καὶ τὰς θηλείας βόας πάσας διδυμοτόκους ἐποίησεν.εἰσὶ δὲ οἱ λέγοντες Ἀφαρέα μὲν καὶ Λεύκιππον ἐκ Περιήρους γενέσθαι τοῦ Αἰόλου, Κυνόρτου δὲ Περιήρην, τοῦ δὲ Οἴβαλον, Οἰβάλου δὲ καὶ νηίδος νύμφης Βατείας Τυνδάρεων Ἱπποκόωντα Ἰκάριον.

[4] But Zeus, fearing that men might acquire the healing art from him and so come to the rescue of each other, smote him with a thunderbolt. Angry on that account, Apollo slew the Cyclopes who had fashioned the thunderbolt for Zeus. But Zeus would have hurled him to Tartarus; however, at the intercession of Latona he ordered him to serve as a thrall to a man for a year. So he went to Admetus, son of Pheres, at Pherae, and served him as a herdsman, and caused all the cows to drop twins.But some say that Aphareus and Leucippus were sons of Perieres, the son of Aeolus, and that Cynortes begat Perieres, and that Perieres begat Oebalus, and that Oebalus begat Tyndareus, Hippocoon, and Icarius by a Naiad nymph Batia.

[5] Ἱπποκόωντος μὲν οὖν ἐγένοντο παῖδες Δορυκλεὺς Σκαῖος Ἐναροφόρος Εὐτείχης Βουκόλος Λύκαιθος Τέβρος Ἱππόθοος Εὔρυτος Ἱπποκορυστὴς Ἀλκίνους Ἄλκων. τούτους Ἱπποκόων ἔχων παῖδας Ἰκάριον καὶ Τυνδάρεων ἐξέβαλε Λακεδαίμονος. οἱ δὲ φεύγουσι πρὸς Θέστιον, καὶ συμμαχοῦσιν αὐτῷ πρὸς τοὺς ὁμόρους πόλεμον ἔχοντι: καὶ γαμεῖ Τυνδάρεως Θεστίου θυγατέρα Λήδαν. αὖθις δέ, ὅτε Ἡρακλῆς Ἱπποκόωντα καὶ τοὺς τούτου παῖδας ἀπέκτεινε, κατέρχονται, καὶ παραλαμβάνει Τυνδάρεως τὴν βασιλείαν.

[5] Now Hippocoon had sons, to wit: Dorycleus, Scaeus, Enarophorus, Eutiches, Bucolus, Lycaethus, Tebrus, Hippothous, Eurytus, Hippocorystes, Alcinus, and Alcon. With the help of these sons Hippocoon expelled Icarius and Tyndareus from Lacedaemon. They fled to Thestius and allied themselves with him in the war which he waged with his neighbors; and Tyndareus married Leda, daughter of Thestius. But afterwards, when Hercules slew Hippocoon and his sons, they returned, and Tyndareus succeeded to the kingdom.

[6] Ἰκαρίου μὲν οὖν καὶ Περιβοίας νύμφης νηίδος Θόας Δαμάσιππος Ἰμεύσιμος Ἀλήτης Περίλεως, καὶ θυγάτηρ Πηνελόπη, ἣν ἔγημεν Ὀδυσσεύς: Τυνδάρεω δὲ καὶ Λήδας Τιμάνδρα, ἣν Ἔχεμος ἔγημε, καὶ Κλυταιμνήστρα, ἣν ἔγημεν Ἀγαμέμνων, ἔτι τε Φυλονόη, ἣν Ἄρτεμις ἀθάνατον ἐποίησε.

[6] Icarius and Periboea, a Naiad nymph, had five sons, Thoas, Damasippus, Imeusimus, Aletes, Perileos, and a daughter Penelope, whom Ulysses married. Tyndareus and Leda had daughters, to wit, Timandra, whom Echemus married, and Clytaemnestra, whom Agamemnon married; also another daughter Phylonoe, whom Artemis made immortal.

[7] Διὸς δὲ Λήδᾳ συνελθόντος ὁμοιωθέντος κύκνῳ, καὶ κατὰ τὴν αὐτὴν νύκτα Τυνδάρεω, Διὸς μὲν ἐγεννήθη Πολυδεύκης καὶ Ἑλένη, Τυνδάρεω δὲ Κάστωρ καὶ Κλυταιμνήστρα. λέγουσι δὲ ἔνιοι Νεμέσεως Ἑλένην εἶναι καὶ Διός. ταύτην γὰρ τὴν Διὸς φεύγουσαν συνουσίαν εἰς χῆνα τὴν μορφὴν μεταβαλεῖν, ὁμοιωθέντα δὲ καὶ Δία κύκνῳ συνελθεῖν: τὴν δὲ ᾠὸν ἐκ τῆς συνουσίας ἀποτεκεῖν, τοῦτο δὲ ἐν τοῖς ἄλσεσιν εὑρόντα τινὰ ποιμένα Λήδᾳ κομίσαντα δοῦναι, τὴν δὲ καταθεμένην εἰς λάρνακα φυλάσσειν, καὶ χρόνῳ καθήκοντι γεννηθεῖσαν Ἑλένην ὡς ἐξ αὑτῆς θυγατέρα τρέφειν. γενομένην δὲ αὐτὴν κάλλει διαπρεπῆ Θησεὺς ἁρπάσας εἰς Ἀφίδνας ἐκόμισε. Πολυδεύκης δὲ καὶ Κάστωρ ἐπιστρατεύσαντες, ἐν Ἅιδου Θησέως ὄντος, αἱροῦσι τὴν πόλιν καὶ τὴν Ἑλένην λαμβάνουσι, καὶ τὴν Θησέως μητέρα Αἴθραν ἄγουσιν αἰχμάλωτον.

[7] But Zeus in the form of a swan consorted with Leda, and on the same night Tyndareus cohabited with her; and she bore Pollux and Helen to Zeus, and Castor and Clytaemnestra to Tyndareus. But some say that Helen was a daughter of Nemesis and Zeus; for that she, flying from the arms of Zeus, changed herself into a goose, but Zeus in his turn took the likeness of a swan and so enjoyed her; and as the fruit of their loves she laid an egg, and a certain shepherd found it in the groves and brought and gave it to Leda; and she put it in a chest and kept it; and when Helen was hatched in due time, Leda brought her up as her own daughter. And when she grew into a lovely woman, Theseus carried her off and brought her to Aphidnae. But when Theseus was in Hades, Pollux and Castor marched against Aphidnae, took the city, got possession of Helen, and led Aethra, the mother of Theseus, away captive.

[8] παρεγένοντο δὲ εἰς Σπάρτην ἐπὶ τὸν Ἑλένης γάμον οἱ βασιλεύοντες Ἑλλάδος. ἦσαν δὲ οἱ μνηστευόμενοι οἵδε: Ὀδυσσεὺς Λαέρτου, Διομήδης Τυδέως, Ἀντίλοχος Νέστορος, Ἀγαπήνωρ Ἀγκαίου, Σθένελος Καπανέως, Ἀμφίμαχος Κτεάτου, Θάλπιος Εὐρύτου, Μέγης Φυλέως, Ἀμφίλοχος Ἀμφιαράου, Μενεσθεὺς Πετεώ, Σχεδίος καὶ Ἐπίστροφος Ἰφίτου, Πολύξενος Ἀγασθένους, Πηνέλεως Ἱππαλκίμου, Λήιτος Ἀλέκτορος, Αἴας Ὀιλέως, Ἀσκάλαφος καὶ Ἰάλμενος Ἄρεος, Ἐλεφήνωρ Χαλκώδοντος, Εὔμηλος Ἀδμήτου, Πολυποίτης Πειρίθου, Λεοντεὺς Κορώνου, Ποδαλείριος καὶ Μαχάων Ἀσκληπιοῦ, Φιλοκτήτης Ποίαντος, Εὐρύπυλος Εὐαίμονος, Πρωτεσίλαος Ιφίκλου, Μενέλαος Ἀτρέως, Αἴας καὶ Τεῦκρος Τελαμῶνος, Πάτροκλος Μενοιτίου.

[8] Now the kings of Greece repaired to Sparta to win the hand of Helen. The wooers were these: — Ulysses, son of Laertes; Diomedes, son of Tydeus; Antilochus, son of Nestor; Agapenor, son of Ancaeus; Sthenelus, son of Capaneus; Amphimachus, son of Cteatus; Thalpius, son of Eurytus; Meges, son of Phyleus; Amphilochus, son of Amphiaraus; Menestheus, son of Peteos; Schedius and Epistrophus, sons of Iphitus; Polyxenus, son of Agasthenes; Peneleos, son of Hippalcimus; Leitus, son of Alector; Ajax, son of Oileus; Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of Ares; Elephenor, son of Chalcodon; Eumelus, son of Admetus; Polypoetes, son of Perithous; Leonteus, son of Coronus; Podalirius and Machaon, sons of Aesculapius; Philoctetes, son of Poeas; Eurypylus, son of Evaemon; Protesilaus, son of Iphiclus; Menelaus, son of Atreus; Ajax and Teucer, sons of Telamon; Patroclus, son of Menoetius.

[9] τούτων ὁρῶν τὸ πλῆθος Τυνδάρεως ἐδεδοίκει μὴ προκριθέντος ἑνὸς στασιάσωσιν οἱ λοιποί. ὑποσχομένου δὲ Ὀδυσσέως, ἐὰν συλλάβηται πρὸς τὸν Πηνελόπης αὐτῷ γάμον, ὑποθήσεσθαι τρόπον τινὰ δι᾽ οὗ μηδεμία γενήσεται στάσις, ὡς ὑπέσχετο αὐτῷ συλλήψεσθαι ὁ Τυνδάρεως, πάντας εἶπεν ἐξορκίσαι τοὺς μνηστῆρας βοηθήσειν, ἐὰν ὁ προκριθεὶς νυμφίος ὑπὸ ἄλλου τινὸς ἀδικῆται περὶ τὸν γάμον. ἀκούσας δὲ τοῦτο Τυνδάρεως τοὺς μνηστῆρας ἐξορκίζει, καὶ Μενέλαον μὲν αὐτὸς αἱρεῖται νυμφίον, Ὀδυσσεῖ δὲ παρὰ Ἰκαρίου μνηστεύεται Πηνελόπην.

[9] Seeing the multitude of them, Tyndareus feared that the preference of one might set the others quarrelling; but Ulysses promised that, if he would help him to win the hand of Penelope, he would suggest a way by which there would be no quarrel. And when Tyndareus promised to help him, Ulysses told him to exact an oath from all the suitors that they would defend the favoured bridegroom against any wrong that might be done him in respect of his marriage. On hearing that, Tyndareus put the suitors on their oath, and while he chose Menelaus to be the bridegroom of Helen, he solicited Icarius to bestow Penelope on Ulysses.

[1] Μενέλαος μὲν οὖν ἐξ Ἑλένης Ἑρμιόνην ἐγέννησε καὶ κατά τινας Νικόστρατον, ἐκ δούλης δὲ Πιερίδος, γένος Αἰτωλίδος, ἢ καθάπερ Ἀκουσίλαός φησι Τηρηίδος, Μεγαπένθη, ἐκ Κνωσσίας δὲ νύμφης κατὰ Εὔμηλον Ξενόδαμον.

[1] Now Menelaus had by Helen a daughter Hermione and, according to some, a son Nicostratus; and by a female slave Pieris, an Aetolian, or, according to Acusilaus, by Tereis, he had a son Megapenthes; and by a nymph Cnossia, according to Eumelus, he had a son Xenodamus.

[2] τῶν δὲ ἐκ Λήδας γενομένων παίδων Κάστωρ μὲν ἤσκει τὰ κατὰ πόλεμον, Πολυδεύκης δὲ πυγμήν, καὶ διὰ τὴν ἀνδρείαν ἐκλήθησαν ἀμφότεροι Διόσκουροι. βουλόμενοι δὲ γῆμαι τὰς Λευκίππου θυγατέρας ἐκ Μεσσήνης ἁρπάσαντες ἔγημαν: καὶ γίνεται μὲν Πολυδεύκους καὶ Φοίβης Μνησίλεως, Κάστορος δὲ καὶ Ἱλαείρας Ἀνώγων. ἐλάσαντες δὲ ἐκ τῆς Ἀρκαδίας βοῶν λείαν μετὰ τῶν Ἀφαρέως παίδων Ἴδα καὶ Λυγκέως, ἐπιτρέπουσιν Ἴδᾳ διελεῖν: ὁ δὲ τεμὼν βοῦν εἰς μέρη τέσσαρα, τοῦ πρώτου καταφαγόντος εἶπε τῆς λείας τὸ ἥμισυ ἔσεσθαι, καὶ τοῦ δευτέρου τὸ λοιπόν. καὶ φθάσας κατηνάλωσε τὸ μέρος τὸ ἴδιον πρῶτος Ἴδας, καὶ τὸ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ, καὶ μετ᾽ ἐκείνου τὴν λείαν εἰς Μεσσήνην ἤλασε. στρατεύσαντες δὲ ἐπὶ Μεσσήνην οἱ Διόσκουροι τήν τε λείαν ἐκείνην καὶ πολλὴν ἄλλην συνελαύνουσι. καὶ τὸν Ἴδαν ἐλόχων καὶ τὸν Λυγκέα. Λυγκεὺς δὲ ἰδὼν Κάστορα ἐμήνυσεν Ἴδᾳ, κἀκεῖνος αὐτὸν κτείνει. Πολυδεύκης δὲ ἐδίωξεν αὐτούς, καὶ τὸν μὲν Λυγκέα κτείνει τὸ δόρυ προέμενος, τὸν δὲ Ἴδαν διώκων, βληθεὶς ὑπ᾽ ἐκείνου πέτρᾳ κατὰ τῆς κεφαλῆς, πίπτει σκοτωθείς. καὶ Ζεὺς Ἴδαν κεραυνοῖ, Πολυδεύκην δὲ εἰς οὐρανὸν ἀνάγει. μὴ δεχομένου δὲ Πολυδεύκους τὴν ἀθανασίαν ὄντος νεκροῦ Κάστορος, Ζεὺς ἀμφοτέροις παρ᾽ ἡμέραν καὶ ἐν θεοῖς εἶναι καὶ ἐν θνητοῖς ἔδωκε. μεταστάντων δὲ εἰς θεοὺς τῶν Διοσκούρων, Τυνδάρεως μεταπεμψάμενος Μενέλαον εἰς Σπάρτην τούτῳ τὴν βασιλείαν παρέδωκεν.

[2] Of the sons born to Leda Castor practised the art of war, and Pollux the art of boxing; and on account of their manliness they were both called Dioscuri. And wishing to marry the daughters of Leucippus, they carried them off from Messene and wedded them; and Pollux had Mnesileus by Phoebe, and Castor had Anogon by Hilaira. And having driven booty of cattle from Arcadia, in company with Idas and Lynceus, sons of Aphareus, they allowed Idas to divide the spoil. He cut a cow in four and said that one half of the booty should be his who ate his share first, and that the rest should be his who ate his share second. And before they knew where they were, Idas had swallowed his own share first and likewise his brother’s, and with him had driven off the captured cattle to Messene. But the Dioscuri marched against Messene, and drove away that cattle and much else besides. And they lay in wait for Idas and Lynceus. But Lynceus spied Castor and discovered him to Idas, who killed him. Pollux chased them and slew Lynceus by throwing his spear, but in pursuing Lynceus he was wounded in the head with a stone thrown by him, and fell down in a swoon. And Zeus smote Idas with a thunderbolt, but Pollux he carried up to heaven. Nevertheless, as Pollux refused to accept immortality while his brother Castor was dead, Zeus permitted them both to be every other day among the gods and among mortals. And when the Dioscuri were translated to the gods, Tyndareus sent for Menelaus to Sparta and handed over the kingdom to him.

[1] Ἠλέκτρας δὲ τῆς Ἄτλαντος καὶ Διὸς Ἰασίων καὶ Δάρδανος ἐγένοντο. Ἰασίων μὲν οὖν ἐρασθεὶς Δήμητρος καὶ θέλων καταισχῦναι τὴν θεὸν κεραυνοῦται, Δάρδανος δὲ ἐπὶ τῷ θανάτῳ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ λυπούμενος, Σαμοθρᾴκην ἀπολιπὼν εἰς τὴν ἀντίπερα ἤπειρον ἦλθε. ταύτης δὲ ἐβασίλευε Τεῦκρος ποταμοῦ Σκαμάνδρου καὶ νύμφης Ἰδαίας: ἀφ᾽ οὗ καὶ οἱ τὴν χώραν νεμόμενοι Τεῦκροι προσηγορεύοντο. ὑποδεχθεὶς δὲ ὑπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ λαβὼν μέρος τῆς γῆς καὶ τὴν ἐκείνου θυγατέρα Βάτειαν, Δάρδανον ἔκτισε πόλιν: τελευτήσαντος δὲ Τεύκρου τὴν χώραν ἅπασαν Δαρδανίαν ἐκάλεσε.

[1] Electra, daughter of Atlas, had two sons, Iasion and Dardanus, by Zeus. Now Iasion loved Demeter, and in an attempt to defile the goddess he was killed by a thunderbolt. Grieved at his brother’s death, Dardanus left Samothrace and came to the opposite mainland. That country was ruled by a king, Teucer, son of the river Scamander and of a nymph Idaea, and the inhabitants of the country were called Teucrians after Teucer. Being welcomed by the king, and having received a share of the land and the king’s daughter Batia, he built a city Dardanus, and when Teucer died he called the whole country Dardania.

[2] γενομένων δὲ αὐτῷ παίδων Ἴλου καὶ Ἐριχθονίου, Ἶλος μὲν ἄπαις ἀπέθανεν, Ἐριχθόνιος δὲ διαδεξάμενος τὴν βασιλείαν, γήμας Ἀστυόχην τὴν Σιμόεντος, τεκνοῖ Τρῶα. οὗτος παραλαβὼν τὴν βασιλείαν τὴν μὲν χώραν ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ Τροίαν ἐκάλεσε, καὶ γήμας Καλλιρρόην τὴν Σκαμάνδρου γεννᾷ θυγατέρα μὲν Κλεοπάτραν, παῖδας δὲ Ἶλον καὶ Ἀσσάρακον καὶ Γανυμήδην. τοῦτον μὲν οὖν διὰ κάλλος ἀναρπάσας Ζεὺς δι᾽ ἀετοῦ θεῶν οἰνοχόον ἐν οὐρανῷ κατέστησεν: Ἀσσαράκου δὲ καὶ Ἱερομνήμης τῆς Σιμόεντος Κάπυς, τοῦ δὲ καὶ Θεμίστης τῆς Ἴλου Ἀγχίσης, ᾧ δι᾽ ἐρωτικὴν ἐπιθυμίαν Ἀφροδίτη συνελθοῦσα Αἰνείαν ἐγέννησε καὶ Λύρον, ὃς ἄπαις ἀπέθανεν.

[2] And he had sons born to him, Ilus and Erichthonius, of whom Ilus died childless, and Erichthonius succeeded to the kingdom and marrying Astyoche, daughter of Simoeis, begat Tros. On succeeding to the kingdom, Tros called the country Troy after himself, and marrying Callirrhoe, daughter of Scamander, he begat a daughter Cleopatra, and sons, Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede. This Ganymede, for the sake of his beauty, Zeus caught up on an eagle and appointed him cupbearer of the gods in heaven; and Assaracus had by his wife Hieromneme, daughter of Simoeis, a son Capys; and Capys had by his wife Themiste, daughter of Ilus, a son Anchises, whom Aphrodite met in love’s dalliance, and to whom she bore Aeneas and Lyrus, who died childless.

[3] Ἶλος δὲ εἰς Φρυγίαν ἀφικόμενος καὶ καταλαβὼν ὑπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως αὐτόθι τεθειμένον ἀγῶνα νικᾷ πάλην: καὶ λαβὼν ἆθλον πεντήκοντα κόρους καὶ κόρας τὰς ἴσας, δόντος αὐτῷ τοῦ βασιλέως κατὰ χρησμὸν καὶ βοῦν ποικίλην, καὶ φράσαντος ἐν ᾧπερ ἂν αὐτὴ κλιθῇ τόπῳ πόλιν κτίζειν, εἵπετο τῇ βοΐ. ἡ δὲ ἀφικομένη ἐπὶ τὸν λεγόμενον τῆς Φρυγίας Ἄτης λόφον κλίνεται: ἔνθα πόλιν κτίσας Ἶλος ταύτην μὲν Ἴλιον ἐκάλεσε, τῷ δὲ Διὶ σημεῖον εὐξάμενος αὐτῷ τι φανῆναι, μεθ᾽ ἡμέραν τὸ διιπετὲς παλλάδιον πρὸ τῆς σκηνῆς κείμενον ἐθεάσατο. ἦν δὲ τῷ μεγέθει τρίπηχυ, τοῖς δὲ ποσὶ συμβεβηκός, καὶ τῇ μὲν δεξιᾷ δόρυ διηρμένον ἔχον τῇ δὲ ἑτέρᾳ ἠλακάτην καὶ ἄτρακτον.ἱστορία δὲ ἡ περὶ τοῦ παλλαδίου τοιάδε φέρεται: φασὶ γεννηθεῖσαν τὴν Ἀθηνᾶν παρὰ Τρίτωνι τρέφεσθαι, ᾧ θυγάτηρ ἦν Παλλάς: ἀμφοτέρας δὲ ἀσκούσας τὰ κατὰ πόλεμον εἰς φιλονεικίαν ποτὲ προελθεῖν. μελλούσης δὲ πλήττειν τῆς Παλλάδος τὸν Δία φοβηθέντα τὴν αἰγίδα προτεῖναι, τὴν δὲ εὐλαβηθεῖσαν ἀναβλέψαι, καὶ οὕτως ὑπὸ τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς τρωθεῖσαν πεσεῖν. Ἀθηνᾶν δὲ περίλυπον ἐπ᾽ αὐτῇ γενομένην, ξόανον ἐκείνης ὅμοιον κατασκευάσαι, καὶ περιθεῖναι τοῖς στέρνοις ἣν ἔδεισεν αἰγίδα, καὶ τιμᾶν ἱδρυσαμένην παρὰ τῷ Διί. ὕστερον δὲ Ἠλέκτρας κατὰ τὴν φθορὰν τούτῳ προσφυγούσης, Δία ῥῖψαι μετ᾽ Ἄτης καὶ τὸ παλλάδιον εἰς τὴν Ἰλιάδα χώραν, Ἶλον δὲ τούτῳ ναὸν κατασκευάσαντα τιμᾶν. καὶ περὶ μὲν τοῦ παλλαδίου ταῦτα λέγεται.Ἶλος δὲ γήμας Εὐρυδίκην τὴν Ἀδράστου Λαομέδοντα ἐγέννησεν, ὃς γαμεῖ Στρυμὼ τὴν Σκαμάνδρου, κατὰ δέ τινας Πλακίαν τὴν Ὀτρέως, κατ᾽ ἐνίους δὲ Λευκίππην, καὶ τεκνοῖ παῖδας μὲν Τιθωνὸν Λάμπον Κλυτίον Ἱκετάονα Ποδάρκην, θυγατέρας δὲ Ἡσιόνην καὶ Κίλλαν καὶ Ἀστυόχην, ἐκ δὲ νύμφης Καλύβης Βουκολίωνα.

[3] But Ilus went to Phrygia, and finding games held there by the king, he was victorious in wrestling. As a prize he received fifty youths and as many maidens, and the king, in obedience to an oracle, gave him also a dappled cow and bade him found a city wherever the animal should lie down; so he followed the cow. And when she was come to what was called the hill of the Phrygian Ate, she lay down; there Ilus built a city and called it Ilium. And having prayed to Zeus that a sign might be shown to him, he beheld by day the Palladium, fallen from heaven, lying before his tent. It was three cubits in height, its feet joined together; in its right hand it held a spear aloft, and in the other hand a distaff and spindle.The story told about the Palladium is as follows: They say that when Athena was born she was brought up by Triton, who had a daughter Pallas; and that both girls practised the arts of war, but that once on a time they fell out; and when Pallas was about to strike a blow, Zeus in fear interposed the aegis, and Pallas, being startled, looked up, and so fell wounded by Athena. And being exceedingly grieved for her, Athena made a wooden image in her likeness, and wrapped the aegis, which she had feared, about the breast of it, and set it up beside Zeus and honored it. But afterwards Electra, at the time of her violation, took refuge at the image, and Zeus threw the Palladium along with Ate into the Ilian country; and Ilus built a temple for it, and honored it. Such is the legend of the Palladium.And Ilus married Eurydice, daughter of Adrastus, and begat Laomedon, who married Strymo, daughter of Scamander; but according to some his wife was Placia, daughter of Otreus, and according to others she was Leucippe; and he begat five sons, Tithonus, Lampus, Clytius, Hicetaon, Podarces, and three daughters, Hesione, Cilla, and Astyoche; and by a nymph Calybe he had a son Bucolion.

[4] Τιθωνὸν μὲν οὖν Ἠὼς ἁρπάσασα δι᾽ ἔρωτα εἰς Αἰθιοπίαν κομίζει, κἀκεῖ συνελθοῦσα γεννᾷ παῖδας Ἠμαθίωνα καὶ Μέμνονα.

[4] Now the Dawn snatched away Tithonus for love and brought him to Ethiopia, and there consorting with him she bore two sons, Emathion and Memnon.

[5] μετὰ δὲ τὸ αἱρεθῆναι Ἴλιον ὑπὸ Ἡρακλέους, ὡς μικρὸν πρόσθεν ἡμῖν λέλεκται, ἐβασίλευσε Ποδάρκης ὁ κληθεὶς Πρίαμος: καὶ γαμεῖ πρώτην Ἀρίσβην τὴν Μέροπος, ἐξ ἧς αὐτῷ παῖς Αἴσακος γίνεται, ὃς ἔγημεν Ἀστερόπην τὴν Κεβρῆνος θυγατέρα, ἣν πενθῶν ἀποθανοῦσαν ἀπωρνεώθη. Πρίαμος δὲ Ἀρίσβην ἐκδοὺς Ὑρτάκῳ δευτέραν ἔγημεν Ἑκάβην τὴν Δύμαντος, ἢ ὥς τινές φασι Κισσέως, ἢ ὡς ἕτεροι λέγουσι Σαγγαρίου ποταμοῦ καὶ Μετώπης. γεννᾶται δὲ αὐτῇ πρῶτος μὲν Ἕκτωρ: δευτέρου δὲ γεννᾶσθαι μέλλοντος βρέφους ἔδοξεν Ἑκάβη καθ᾽ ὕπνους δαλὸν τεκεῖν διάπυρον, τοῦτον δὲ πᾶσαν ἐπινέμεσθαι τὴν πόλιν καὶ καίειν. μαθὼν δὲ Πρίαμος παρ᾽ Ἑκάβης τὸν ὄνειρον, Αἴσακον τὸν υἱὸν μετεπέμψατο: ἦν γὰρ ὀνειροκρίτης παρὰ τοῦ μητροπάτορος Μέροπος διδαχθείς. οὗτος εἰπὼν τῆς πατρίδος γενέσθαι τὸν παῖδα ἀπώλειαν, ἐκθεῖναι τὸ βρέφος ἐκέλευε. Πρίαμος δέ, ὡς ἐγεννήθη τὸ βρέφος, δίδωσιν ἐκθεῖναι οἰκέτῃ κομίσαντι εἰς Ἴδην: ὁ δὲ οἰκέτης Ἀγέλαος ὠνομάζετο. τὸ δὲ ἐκτεθὲν ὑπὸ τούτου βρέφος πένθ᾽ ἡμέρας ὑπὸ ἄρκτου ἐτράφη. ὁ δὲ σωζόμενον εὑρὼν ἀναιρεῖται, καὶ κομίσας ἐπὶ τῶν χωρίων ὡς ἴδιον παῖδα ἔτρεφεν, ὀνομάσας Πάριν. γενόμενος δὲ νεανίσκος καὶ πολλῶν διαφέρων κάλλει τε καὶ ῥώμῃ αὖθις Ἀλέξανδρος προσωνομάσθη, λῃστὰς ἀμυνόμενος καὶ τοῖς ποιμνίοις ἀλεξήσας , ὅπερ ἐστὶ βοηθήσας. καὶ μετ᾽ οὐ πολὺ τοὺς γονέας ἀνεῦρε.μετὰ τοῦτον ἐγέννησεν Ἑκάβη θυγατέρας μὲν Κρέουσαν Λαοδίκην Πολυξένην Κασάνδραν, ᾗ συνελθεῖν βουλόμενος Ἀπόλλων τὴν μαντικὴν ὑπέσχετο διδάξειν. ἡ δὲ μαθοῦσα οὐ συνῆλθεν: ὅθεν Ἀπόλλων ἀφείλετο τῆς μαντικῆς αὐτῆς τὸ πείθειν. αὖθις δὲ παῖδας ἐγέννησε Δηίφοβον Ἕλενον Πάμμονα Πολίτην Ἄντιφον Ἱππόνοον Πολύδωρον Τρωίλον: τοῦτον ἐξ Ἀπόλλωνος λέγεται γεγεννηκέναι.ἐκ δὲ ἄλλων γυναικῶν Πριάμῳ παῖδες γίνονται Μελάνιππος Γοργυθίων Φιλαίμων Ἱππόθοος Γλαῦκος, Ἀγάθων Χερσιδάμας Εὐαγόρας Ἱπποδάμας Μήστωρ, Ἄτας Δόρυκλος Λυκάων Δρύοψ Βίας, Χρομίος Ἀστύγονος Τελέστας Εὔανδρος Κεβριόνης, Μύλιος Ἀρχέμαχος Λαοδόκος Ἐχέφρων Ἰδομενεύς, Ὑπερίων Ἀσκάνιος Δημοκόων Ἄρητος Δηιοπίτης, Κλονίος Ἐχέμμων Ὑπείροχος Αἰγεωνεὺς Λυσίθοος Πολυμέδων, θυγατέρες δὲ Μέδουσα Μηδεσικάστη Λυσιμάχη Ἀριστοδήμη.

[5] But after that Ilium was captured by Hercules, as we have related a little before, Podarces, who was called Priam, came to the throne, and he married first Arisbe, daughter of Merops, by whom he had a son Aesacus, who married Asterope, daughter of Cebren, and when she died he mourned for her and was turned into a bird. But Priam handed over Arisbe to Hyrtacus and married a second wife Hecuba, daughter of Dymas, or, as some say, of Cisseus, or, as others say, of the river Sangarius and Metope. The first son born to her was Hector; and when a second babe was about to be born Hecuba dreamed she had brought forth a firebrand, and that the fire spread over the whole city and burned it. When Priam learned of the dream from Hecuba, he sent for his son Aesacus, for he was an interpreter of dreams, having been taught by his mother’s father Merops. He declared that the child was begotten to be the ruin of his country and advised that the babe should be exposed. When the babe was born Priam gave it to a servant to take and expose on Ida; now the servant was named Agelaus. Exposed by him, the infant was nursed for five days by a bear; and, when he found it safe, he took it up, carried it away, brought it up as his own son on his farm, and named him Paris. When he grew to be a young man, Paris excelled many in beauty and strength, and was afterwards surnamed Alexander, because he repelled robbers and defended the flocks. And not long afterwards he discovered his parents.After him Hecuba gave birth to daughters, Creusa, Laodice, Polyxena, and Cassandra. Wishing to gain Cassandra’s favours, Apollo promised to teach her the art of prophecy; she learned the art but refused her favours; hence Apollo deprived her prophecy of power to persuade. Afterwards Hecuba bore sons, Deiphobus, Helenus, Pammon, Polites, Antiphus, Hipponous, Polydorus, and Troilus: this last she is said to have had by Apollo.By other women Priam had sons, to wit, Melanippus, Gorgythion, Philaemon, Hippothous, Glaucus, Agathon, Chersidamas, Evagoras, Hippodamas, Mestor, Atas, Doryclus, Lycaon, Dryops, Bias, Chromius, Astygonus, Telestas, Evander, Cebriones, Mylius, Archemachus, Laodocus, Echephron, Idomeneus, Hyperion, Ascanius, Democoon, Aretus, Deiopites, Clonius, Echemmon, Hypirochus, Aegeoneus, Lysithous, Polymedon; and daughters, to wit, Medusa, Medesicaste, Lysimache, and Aristodeme.

[6] Ἕκτωρ μὲν οὖν Ἀνδρομάχην τὴν Ἠετίωνος γαμεῖ, Ἀλέξανδρος δὲ Οἰνώνην τὴν Κεβρῆνος τοῦ ποταμοῦ θυγατέρα. αὕτη παρὰ Ῥέας τὴν μαντικὴν μαθοῦσα προέλεγεν Ἀλεξάνδρῳ μὴ πλεῖν ἐπὶ Ἑλένην. μὴ πείθουσα δὲ εἶπεν, ἐὰν τρωθῇ, παραγενέσθαι πρὸς αὐτήν: μόνην γὰρ θεραπεῦσαι δύνασθαι. τὸν δὲ Ἑλένην ἐκ Σπάρτης ἁρπάσαι, πολεμουμένης δὲ Τροίας τοξευθέντα ὑπὸ Φιλοκτήτου τόξοις Ἡρακλείοις πρὸς Οἰνώνην ἐπανελθεῖν εἰς Ἴδην. ἡ δὲ μνησικακοῦσα θεραπεύσειν οὐκ ἔφη. Ἀλέξανδρος μὲν οὖν εἰς Τροίαν κομιζόμενος ἐτελεύτα, Οἰνώνη δὲ μετανοήσασα τὰ πρὸς θεραπείαν φάρμακα ἔφερε, καὶ καταλαβοῦσα αὐτὸν νεκρὸν ἑαυτὴν ἀνήρτησεν.ὁ δὲ Ἀσωπὸς ποταμὸς Ὠκεανοῦ καὶ Τηθύος, ὡς δὲ Ἀκουσίλαος λέγει, Πηροῦς καὶ Ποσειδῶνος, ὡς δέ τινες, Διὸς καὶ Εὐρυνόμης. τούτῳ Μετώπη γημαμένη （Λάδωνος δὲ τοῦ ποταμοῦ θυγάτηρ αὕτη） δύο μὲν παῖδας ἐγέννησεν, Ἰσμηνὸν καὶ Πελάγοντα, εἴκοσι δὲ θυγατέρας, ὧν μὲν μίαν Αἴγιναν ἥρπασε Ζεύς. ταύτην Ἀσωπὸς ζητῶν ἧκεν εἰς Κόρινθον, καὶ μανθάνει παρὰ Σισύφου τὸν ἡρπακότα εἶναι Δία. Ζεὺς δὲ Ἀσωπὸν μὲν κεραυνώσας διώκοντα πάλιν ἐπὶ τὰ οἰκεῖα ἀπέπεμψε ῥεῖθρα （διὰ τοῦτο μέχρι καὶ νῦν ἐκ τῶν τούτου ῥείθρων ἄνθρακες φέρονται）, Αἴγιναν δὲ κομίσας εἰς τὴν τότε Οἰνώνην λεγομένην νῆσον, νῦν δὲ Αἴγιναν ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνης κληθεῖσαν, μίγνυται, καὶ τεκνοῖ παῖδα ἐξ αὐτῆς Αἰακόν. τούτῳ Ζεὺς ὄντι μόνῳ ἐν τῇ νήσῳ τοὺς μύρμηκας ἀνθρώπους ἐποίησε. γαμεῖ δὲ Αἰακὸς Ἐνδηίδα τὴν Σκείρωνος, ἐξ ἧς αὐτῷ παῖδες ἐγένοντο Πηλεύς τε καὶ Τελαμών. Φερεκύδης δέ φησι Τελαμῶνα φίλον, οὐκ ἀδελφὸν Πηλέως εἶναι, ἀλλ᾽ Ἀκταίου παῖδα καὶ Γλαύκης τῆς Κυχρέως. μίγνυται δὲ αὖθις Αἰακὸς Ψαμάθῃ τῇ Νηρέως εἰς φώκην ἠλλαγμένῃ διὰ τὸ μὴ βούλεσθαι συνελθεῖν, καὶ τεκνοῖ παῖδα Φῶκον.ἦν δὲ εὐσεβέστατος πάντων Αἰακός. διὸ καὶ τὴν Ἑλλάδα κατεχούσης ἀφορίας διὰ Πέλοπα, ὅτι Στυμφάλῳ τῷ βασιλεῖ τῶν Ἀρκάδων πολεμῶν καὶ τὴν Ἀρκαδίαν ἑλεῖν μὴ δυνάμενος, προσποιησάμενος φιλίαν ἔκτεινεν αὐτὸν καὶ διέσπειρε μελίσας, χρησμοὶ θεῶν ἔλεγον ἀπαλλαγήσεσθαι τῶν ἐνεστώτων κακῶν τὴν Ἑλλάδα, ἐὰν Αἰακὸς ὑπὲρ αὐτῆς εὐχὰς ποιήσηται ποιησαμένου δὲ εὐχὰς Αἰακοῦ τῆς ἀκαρπίας ἡ Ἑλλὰς ἀπαλλάττεται. τιμᾶται δὲ καὶ παρὰ Πλούτωνι τελευτήσας Αἰακός, καὶ τὰς κλεῖς τοῦ Ἅιδου φυλάττει.διαφέροντος δὲ ἐν τοῖς ἀγῶσι Φώκου, τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς Πηλέα καὶ Τελαμῶνα ἐπιβουλεῦσαι: καὶ λαχὼν κλήρῳ Τελαμὼν συγγυμναζόμενον αὐτὸν βαλὼν δίσκῳ κατὰ τῆς κεφαλῆς κτείνει, καὶ κομίσας μετὰ Πηλέως κρύπτει κατά τινος ὕλης. φωραθέντος δὲ τοῦ φόνου φυγάδες ἀπὸ Αἰγίνης ὑπὸ Αἰακοῦ ἐλαύνονται.

[6] Now Hector married Andromache, daughter of Eetion, and Alexander married Oenone, daughter of the river Cebren. She had learned from Rhea the art of prophecy, and warned Alexander not to sail to fetch Helen; but failing to persuade him, she told him to come to her if he were wounded, for she alone could heal him. When he had carried off Helen from Sparta and Troy was besieged, he was shot by Philoctetes with the bow of Hercules, and went back to Oenone on Ida. But she, nursing her grievance, refused to heal him. So Alexander was carried to Troy and died. But Oenone repented her, and brought the healing drugs; and finding him dead she hanged herself.The Asopus river was a son of Ocean and Tethys, or, as Acusilaus says, of Pero and Poseidon, or, according to some, of Zeus and Eurynome. Him Metope, herself a daughter of the river Ladon, married and bore two sons, Ismenus and Pelagon, and twenty daughters, of whom one, Aegina, was carried off by Zeus. In search of her Asopus came to Corinth, and learned from Sisyphus that the ravisher was Zeus. Asopus pursued him, but Zeus, by hurling thunderbolts, sent him away back to his own streams; hence coals are fetched to this day from the streams of that river. And having conveyed Aegina to the island then named Oenone, but now called Aegina after her, Zeus cohabited with her and begot a son Aeacus on her. As Aeacus was alone in the island, Zeus made the ants into men for him. And Aeacus married Endeis, daughter of Sciron, by whom he had two sons, Peleus and Telamon. But Pherecydes says that Telamon was a friend, not a brother of Peleus, he being a son of Actaeus and Glauce, daughter of Cychreus. Afterwards Aeacus cohabited with Psamathe, daughter of Nereus, who turned herself into a seal to avoid his embraces, and he begot a son Phocus.Now Aeacus was the most pious of men. Therefore, when Greece suffered from infertility on account of Pelops, because in a war with Stymphalus, king of the Arcadians, being unable to conquer Arcadia, he slew the king under a pretence of friendship, and scattered his mangled limbs, oracles of the gods declared that Greece would be rid of its present calamities if Aeacus would offer prayers on its behalf. So Aeacus did offer prayers, and Greece was delivered from the dearth. Even after his death Aeacus is honored in the abode of Pluto, and keeps the keys of Hades.As Phocus excelled in athletic sports, his brothers Peleus and Telamon plotted against him, and the lot falling on Telamon, he killed his brother in a match by throwing a quoit at his head, and with the help of Peleus carried the body and hid it in a wood. But the murder being detected, the two were driven fugitives from Aegina by Aeacus.

[7] καὶ Τελαμὼν μὲν εἰς Σαλαμῖνα παραγίνεται πρὸς Κυχρέα τὸν Ποσειδῶνος καὶ Σαλαμῖνος τῆς Ἀσωποῦ. κτείνας δὲ ὄφιν οὗτος ἀδικοῦντα τὴν νῆσον αὐτῆς ἐβασίλευε, καὶ τελευτῶν ἄπαις τὴν βασιλείαν παραδίδωσι Τελαμῶνι. ὁ δὲ γαμεῖ Περίβοιαν τὴν Ἀλκάθου τοῦ Πέλοπος: καὶ ποιησαμένου εὐχὰς Ἡρακλέους ἵνα αὐτῷ παῖς ἄρρην γένηται, φανέντος δὲ μετὰ τὰς εὐχὰς αἰετοῦ, τὸν γεννηθέντα ἐκάλεσεν Αἴαντα. καὶ στρατευσάμενος ἐπὶ Τροίαν σὺν Ἡρακλεῖ λαμβάνει γέρας Ἡσιόνην τὴν Λαομέδοντος θυγατέρα, ἐξ ἧς αὐτῷ γίνεται Τεῦκρος.

[7] And Telamon betook himself to Salamis, to the court of Cychreus, son of Poseidon and Salamis, daughter of Asopus. This Cychreus became king of Salamis through killing a snake which ravaged the island, and dying childless he bequeathed the kingdom to Telamon. And Telamon married Periboea, daughter of Alcathus, son of Pelops, and called his son Ajax, because when Hercules had prayed that he might have a male child, an eagle appeared after the prayer. And having gone with Hercules on his expedition against Troy, he received as a prize Hesione, daughter of Laomedon, by whom he had a son Teucer.

[1] Πηλεὺς δὲ εἰς Φθίαν φυγὼν πρὸς Εὐρυτίωνα τὸν Ἄκτορος ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ καθαίρεται, καὶ λαμβάνει παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ τὴν θυγατέρα Ἀντιγόνην καὶ τῆς χώρας τὴν τρίτην μοῖραν. καὶ γίνεται θυγάτηρ αὐτῷ Πολυδώρα, ἣν ἔγημε Βῶρος ὁ Περιήρους.

[1] Peleus fled to Phthia to the court of Eurytion, son of Actor, and was purified by him, and he received from him his daughter Antigone and the third part of the country. And a daughter Polydora was born to him, who was wedded by Borus, son of Perieres.

[2] ἐντεῦθεν ἐπὶ τὴν θήραν τοῦ Καλυδωνίου κάπρου μετ᾽ Εὐρυτίωνος ἐλθών, προέμενος ἐπὶ τὸν σῦν ἀκόντιον Εὐρυτίωνος τυγχάνει καὶ κτείνει τοῦτον ἄκων. πάλιν οὖν ἐκ Φθίας φυγὼν εἰς Ἰωλκὸν πρὸς Ἄκαστον ἀφικνεῖται καὶ ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ καθαίρεται.

[2] Thence he went with Eurytion to hunt the Calydonian boar, but in throwing a dart at the hog he involuntarily struck and killed Eurytion. Therefore flying again from Phthia he betook him to Acastus at Iolcus and was purified by him.

[3] ἀγωνίζεται δὲ καὶ τὸν ἐπὶ Πελίᾳἀγῶνα, πρὸς Ἀταλάντην διαπαλαίσας. καὶ Ἀστυδάμεια ἡ Ἀκάστου γυνή, Πηλέως ἐρασθεῖσα, περὶ συνουσίας προσέπεμψεν αὐτῷ λόγους. μὴ δυναμένη δὲ πεῖσαι, πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ πέμψασα ἔφη μέλλειν Πηλέα γαμεῖν Στερόπην τὴν Ἀκάστου θυγατέρα: καὶ τοῦτο ἐκείνη ἀκούσασα ἀγχόνην ἀνάπτει. Πηλέως δὲ πρὸς Ἄκαστον καταψεύδεται, λέγουσα ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ περὶ συνουσίας πεπειρᾶσθαι. Ἄκαστος δὲ ἀκούσας κτεῖναι μὲν ὃν ἐκάθηρεν οὐκ ἠβουλήθη, ἄγει δὲ αὐτὸν ἐπὶ θήραν εἰς τὸ Πήλιον. ἔνθα ἁμίλλης περὶ θήρας γενομένης, Πηλεὺς μὲν ὧν ἐχειροῦτο θηρίων τὰς γλώσσας τούτων ἐκτεμὼν εἰς πήραν ἐτίθει, οἱ δὲ μετὰ Ἀκάστου ταῦτα χειρούμενοι κατεγέλων ὡς μηδὲν τεθηρακότος τοῦ Πηλέως. ὁ δὲ τὰς γλώσσας παρασχόμενος ὅσας εἶχεν ἐκείνοις, τοσαῦτα ἔφη τεθηρευκέναι. ἀποκοιμηθέντος δὲ αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ Πηλίῳ, ἀπολιπὼν Ἄκαστος καὶ τὴν μάχαιραν ἐν τῇ τῶν βοῶν κόπρῳ κρύψας ἐπανέρχεται. ὁ δὲ ἐξαναστὰς καὶ ζητῶν τὴν μάχαιραν, ὑπὸ τῶν Κενταύρων καταληφθεὶς ἔμελλεν ἀπόλλυσθαι, σώζεται δὲ ὑπὸ Χείρωνος: οὗτος καὶ τὴν μάχαιραν αὐτοῦ ἐκζητήσας δίδωσι.

[3] And at the games celebrated in honor of Pelias he contended in wrestling with Atalanta. And Astydamia, wife of Acastus, fell in love with Peleus, and sent him a proposal for a meeting; and when she could not prevail on him she sent word to his wife that Peleus was about to marry Sterope, daughter of Acastus; on hearing which the wife of Peleus strung herself up. And the wife of Acastus falsely accused Peleus to her husband, alleging that he had attempted her virtue. On hearing that, Acastus would not kill the man whom he had purified, but took him to hunt on Pelion. There a contest taking place in regard to the hunt, Peleus cut out and put in his pouch the tongues of the animals that fell to him, while the party of Acastus bagged his game and derided him as if he had taken nothing. But he produced them the tongues, and said that he had taken just as many animals as he had tongues. When he had fallen asleep on Pelion, Acastus deserted him, and hiding his sword in the cows’ dung, returned. On arising and looking for his sword, Peleus was caught by the centaurs and would have perished, if he had not been saved by Chiron, who also restored him his sword, which he had sought and found.

[4] γαμεῖ δὲ ὁ Πηλεὺς Πολυδώραν τὴν Περιήρους, ἐξ ἧς αὐτῷ γίνεται Μενέσθιος ἐπίκλην, ὁ Σπερχειοῦ τοῦ ποταμοῦ.

[4] Peleus married Polydora, daughter of Perieres, by whom he had a putative son Menesthius, though in fact Menesthius was the son of the river Sperchius.

[5] αὖθις δὲ γαμεῖ Θέτιν τὴν Νηρέως, περὶ ἧς τοῦ γάμου Ζεὺς καὶ Ποσειδῶν ἤρισαν, Θέμιδος δὲ θεσπιῳδούσης ἔσεσθαι τὸν ἐκ ταύτης γεννηθέντα κρείττονα τοῦ πατρὸς ἀπέσχοντο. ἔνιοι δέ φασι, Διὸς ὁρμῶντος ἐπὶ τὴν ταύτης συνουσίαν, εἰρηκέναι Προμηθέα τὸν ἐκ ταύτης αὐτῷ γεννηθέντα οὐρανοῦ δυναστεύσειν. τινὲς δὲ λέγουσι Θέτιν μὴ βουληθῆναι Διὶ συνελθεῖν ὡς ὑπὸ Ἥρας τραφεῖσαν, Δία δὲ ὀργισθέντα θνητῷ θέλειν αὐτὴν συνοικίσαι. Χείρωνος οὖν ὑποθεμένου Πηλεῖ συλλαβεῖν καὶ κατασχεῖν αὐτὴν μεταμορφουμένην, ἐπιτηρήσας συναρπάζει, γινομένην δὲ ὁτὲ μὲν πῦρ ὁτὲ δὲ ὕδωρ ὁτὲ δὲ θηρίον οὐ πρότερον ἀνῆκε πρὶν ἢ τὴν ἀρχαίαν μορφὴν εἶδεν ἀπολαβοῦσαν. γαμεῖ δὲ ἐν τῷ Πηλίῳ, κἀκεῖ θεοὶ τὸν γάμον εὐωχούμενοι καθύμνησαν. καὶ δίδωσι Χείρων Πηλεῖ δόρυ μείλινον, Ποσειδῶν δὲ ἵππους Βαλίον καὶ Ξάνθον: ἀθάνατοι δὲ ἦσαν οὗτοι.

[5] Afterwards he married Thetis, daughter of Nereus, for whose hand Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals; but when Themis prophesied that the son born of Thetis would be mightier than his father, they withdrew. But some say that when Zeus was bent on gratifying his passion for her, Prometheus declared that the son borne to him by her would be lord of heaven; and others affirm that Thetis would not consort with Zeus because she had been brought up by Hera, and that Zeus in anger would marry her to a mortal. Chiron, therefore, having advised Peleus to seize her and hold her fast in spite of her shape-shifting, he watched his chance and carried her off, and though she turned, now into fire, now into water, and now into a beast, he did not let her go till he saw that she had resumed her former shape. And he married her on Pelion, and there the gods celebrated the marriage with feast and song. And Chiron gave Peleus an ashen spear, and Poseidon gave him horses, Balius and Xanthus, and these were immortal.

[6] ὡς δὲ ἐγέννησε Θέτις ἐκ Πηλέως βρέφος, ἀθάνατον θέλουσα ποιῆσαι τοῦτο, κρύφα Πηλέως εἰς τὸ πῦρ ἐγκρύβουσα τῆς νυκτὸς ἔφθειρεν ὃ ἦν αὐτῷ θνητὸν πατρῷον, μεθ᾽ ἡμέραν δὲ ἔχριεν ἀμβροσίᾳ. Πηλεὺς δὲ ἐπιτηρήσας καὶ σπαίροντα τὸν παῖδα ἰδὼν ἐπὶ τοῦ πυρὸς ἐβόησε: καὶ Θέτις κωλυθεῖσα τὴν προαίρεσιν τελειῶσαι, νήπιον τὸν παῖδα ἀπολιποῦσα πρὸς Νηρηίδας ᾤχετο. κομίζει δὲ τὸν παῖδα πρὸς Χείρωνα Πηλεύς. ὁ δὲ λαβὼν αὐτὸν ἔτρεφε σπλάγχνοις λεόντων καὶ συῶν ἀγρίων καὶ ἄρκτων μυελοῖς, καὶ ὠνόμασεν Ἀχιλλέα （πρότερον δὲ ἦν ὄνομα αὐτῷ Λιγύρων） ὅτι τὰ χείλη μαστοῖς οὐ προσήνεγκε.

[6] When Thetis had got a babe by Peleus, she wished to make it immortal, and unknown to Peleus she used to hide it in the fire by night in order to destroy the mortal element which the child inherited from its father, but by day she anointed him with ambrosia. But Peleus watched her, and, seeing the child writhing on the fire, he cried out; and Thetis, thus prevented from accomplishing her purpose, forsook her infant son and departed to the Nereids. Peleus brought the child to Chiron, who received him and fed him on the inwards of lions and wild swine and the marrows of bears, and named him Achilles, because he had not put his lips to the breast; but before that time his name was Ligyron.

[7] Πηλεὺς δὲ μετὰ ταῦτα σὺν Ἰάσονι καὶ Διοσκούροις ἐπόρθησεν Ἰωλκόν, καὶ Ἀστυδάμειαν τὴν Ἀκάστου γυναῖκα φονεύει, καὶ διελὼν μεληδὸν διήγαγε δι᾽ αὐτῆς τὸν στρατὸν εἰς τὴν πόλιν.

[7] After that Peleus, with Jason and the Dioscuri, laid waste Iolcus; and he slaughtered Astydamia, wife of Acastus, and, having divided her limb from limb, he led the army through her into the city.

[8] ὡς δὲ ἐγένετο ἐνναετὴς Ἀχιλλεύς, Κάλχαντος λέγοντος οὐ δύνασθαι χωρὶς αὐτοῦ Τροίαν αἱρεθῆναι, Θέτις προειδυῖα ὅτι δεῖ στρατευόμενον αὐτὸν ἀπολέσθαι, κρύψασα ἐσθῆτι γυναικείᾳ ὡς παρθένον Λυκομήδει παρέθετο. κἀκεῖ τρεφόμενος τῇ Λυκομήδους θυγατρὶ Δηιδαμείᾳ μίγνυται, καὶ γίνεται παῖς Πύρρος αὐτῷ ὁ κληθεὶς Νεοπτόλεμος αὖθις. Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ μηνυθέντα παρὰ Λυκομήδει ζητῶν Ἀχιλλέα, σάλπιγγι χρησάμενος εὗρε. καὶ τοῦτον τὸν τρόπον εἰς Τροίαν ἦλθε.συνείπετο δὲ αὐτῷ Φοῖνιξ ὁ Ἀμύντορος. οὗτος ὑπὸ τοῦ πατρὸς ἐτυφλώθη καταψευσαμένης φθορὰν Φθίας τῆς τοῦ πατρὸς παλλακῆς. Πηλεὺς δὲ αὐτὸν πρὸς Χείρωνα κομίσας, ὑπ᾽ ἐκείνου θεραπευθέντα τὰς ὄψεις βασιλέα κατέστησε Δολόπων.συνείπετο δὲ καὶ Πάτροκλος ὁ Μενοιτίου καὶ Σθενέλης τῆς Ἀκάστου ἢ Περιώπιδος τῆς Φέρητος, ἢ καθάπερ φησὶ Φιλοκράτης, Πολυμήλης τῆς Πηλέως. οὗτος ἐν Ὀποῦντι διενεχθεὶς ἐν παιδιᾷ περὶ ἀστραγάλων παῖδα Κλειτώνυμον τὸν Ἀμφιδάμαντος ἀπέκτεινε, καὶ φυγὼν μετὰ τοῦ πατρὸς παρὰ Πηλεῖ κατῴκει, καὶ Ἀχιλλέως ἐρώμενος γίνεται. ...

[8] When Achilles was nine years old, Calchas declared that Troy could not be taken without him; so Thetis, foreseeing that it was fated he should perish if he went to the war, disguised him in female garb and entrusted him as a maiden to Lycomedes. Bred at his court, Achilles had an intrigue with Deidamia, daughter of Lycomedes, and a son Pyrrhus was born to him, who was afterwards called Neoptolemus. But the secret of Achilles was betrayed, and Ulysses, seeking him at the court of Lycomedes, discovered him by the blast of a trumpet. And in that way Achilles went to Troy.He was accompanied by Phoenix, son of Amyntor. This Phoenix had been blinded by his father on the strength of a false accusation of seduction preferred against him by his father’s concubine Phthia. But Peleus brought him to Chiron, who restored his sight, and thereupon Peleus made him king of the Dolopians.Achilles was also accompanied by Patroclus, son of Menoetius and Sthenele, daughter of Acastus; or the mother of Patroclus was Periopis, daughter of Pheres, or, as Philocrates says, she was Polymele, daughter of Peleus. At Opus, in a quarrel over a game of dice, Patroclus killed the boy Clitonymus, son of Amphidamas, and flying with his father he dwelt at the house of Peleus and became a minion of Achilles. ...

[1] Κέκροψ αὐτόχθων, συμφυὲς ἔχων σῶμα ἀνδρὸς καὶ δράκοντος, τῆς Ἀττικῆς ἐβασίλευσε πρῶτος, καὶ τὴν γῆν πρότερον λεγομένην Ἀκτὴν ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ Κεκροπίαν ὠνόμασεν. ἐπὶ τούτου, φασίν, ἔδοξε τοῖς θεοῖς πόλεις καταλαβέσθαι, ἐν αἷς ἔμελλον ἔχειν τιμὰς ἰδίας ἕκαστος. ἧκεν οὖν πρῶτος Ποσειδῶν ἐπὶ τὴν Ἀττικήν, καὶ πλήξας τῇ τριαίνῃ κατὰ μέσην τὴν ἀκρόπολιν ἀπέφηνε θάλασσαν, ἣν νῦν Ἐρεχθηίδα καλοῦσι. μετὰ δὲ τοῦτον ἧκεν Ἀθηνᾶ, καὶ ποιησαμένη τῆς καταλήψεως Κέκροπα μάρτυρα ἐφύτευσεν ἐλαίαν, ἣ νῦν ἐν τῷ Πανδροσείῳ δείκνυται. γενομένης δὲ ἔριδος ἀμφοῖν περὶ τῆς χώρας, διαλύσας Ζεὺς κριτὰς ἔδωκεν, οὐχ ὡς εἶπόν τινες, Κέκροπα καὶ Κραναόν, οὐδὲ Ἐρυσίχθονα, θεοὺς δὲ τοὺς δώδεκα. καὶ τούτων δικαζόντων ἡ χώρα τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς ἐκρίθη, Κέκροπος μαρτυρήσαντος ὅτι πρώτη τὴν ἐλαίαν ἐφύτευσεν. Ἀθηνᾶ μὲν οὖν ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτῆς τὴν πόλιν ἐκάλεσεν Ἀθήνας, Ποσειδῶν δὲ θυμῷ ὀργισθεὶς τὸ Θριάσιον πεδίον ἐπέκλυσε καὶ τὴν Ἀττικὴν ὕφαλον ἐποίησε.

[1] Cecrops, a son of the soil, with a body compounded of man and serpent, was the first king of Attica, and the country which was formerly called Acte he named Cecropia after himself. In his time, they say, the gods resolved to take possession of cities in which each of them should receive his own peculiar worship. So Poseidon was the first that came to Attica, and with a blow of his trident on the middle of the acropolis, he produced a sea which they now call Erechtheis. After him came Athena, and, having called on Cecrops to witness her act of taking possession, she planted an olive tree, which is still shown in the Pandrosium. But when the two strove for possession of the country, Zeus parted them and appointed arbiters, not, as some have affirmed, Cecrops and Cranaus, nor yet Erysichthon, but the twelve gods. And in accordance with their verdict the country was adjudged to Athena, because Cecrops bore witness that she had been the first to plant the olive. Athena, therefore, called the city Athens after herself, and Poseidon in hot anger flooded the Thriasian plain and laid Attica under the sea.

[2] Κέκροψ δὲ γήμας τὴν Ἀκταίου κόρην Ἄγραυλον παῖδα μὲν ἔσχεν Ἐρυσίχθονα, ὃς ἄτεκνος μετήλλαξε, θυγατέρας δὲ Ἄγραυλον Ἕρσην Πάνδροσον. Ἀγραύλου μὲν οὖν καὶ Ἄρεος Ἀλκίππη γίνεται. ταύτην βιαζόμενος Ἁλιρρόθιος, ὁ Ποσειδῶνος καὶ νύμφης Εὐρύτης, ὑπὸ Ἄρεος φωραθεὶς κτείνεται. Ποσειδῶνος δὲ εἰσάγοντος ἐν Ἀρείῳ πάγῳ κρίνεται δικαζόντων τῶν δώδεκα θεῶν Ἄρης καὶ ἀπολύεται.

[2] Cecrops married Agraulus, daughter of Actaeus, and had a son Erysichthon, who departed this life childless; and Cecrops had daughters, Agraulus, Herse, and Pandrosus. Agraulus had a daughter Alcippe by Ares. In attempting to violate Alcippe, Halirrhothius, son of Poseidon and a nymph Euryte, was detected and killed by Ares. Impeached by Poseidon, Ares was tried in the Areopagus before the twelve gods, and was acquitted.

[3] Ἕρσης δὲ καὶ Ἑρμοῦ Κέφαλος, οὗ ἐρασθεῖσα Ἠὼς ἥρπασε καὶ μιγεῖσα ἐν Συρίᾳ παῖδα ἐγέννησε Τιθωνόν, οὗ παῖς ἐγένετο Φαέθων, τούτου δὲ Ἀστύνοος, τοῦ δὲ Σάνδοκος, ὃς ἐκ Συρίας ἐλθὼν εἰς Κιλικίαν, πόλιν ἔκτισε Κελένδεριν, καὶ γήμας Φαρνάκην τὴν Μεγασσάρου τοῦ Ὑριέων βασιλέως ἐγέννησε Κινύραν. οὗτος ἐν Κύπρῳ, παραγενόμενος σὺν λαῷ, ἔκτισε Πάφον, γήμας δὲ ἐκεῖ Μεθάρμην, κόρην Πυγμαλίωνος Κυπρίων βασιλέως, Ὀξύπορον ἐγέννησε καὶ Ἄδωνιν, πρὸς δὲ τούτοις θυγατέρας Ὀρσεδίκην καὶ Λαογόρην καὶ Βραισίαν. αὗται δὲ διὰ μῆνιν Ἀφροδίτης ἀλλοτρίοις ἀνδράσι συνευναζόμεναι τὸν βίον ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ μετήλλαξαν.

[3] Herse had by Hermes a son Cephalus, whom Dawn loved and carried off, and consorting with him in Syria bore a son Tithonus, who had a son Phaethon, who had a son Astynous, who had a son Sandocus, who passed from Syria to Cilicia and founded a city Celenderis, and having married Pharnace, daughter of Megassares, king of Hyria, begat Cinyras. This Cinyras in Cyprus, whither he had come with some people, founded Paphos; and having there married Metharme, daughter of Pygmalion, king of Cyprus, he begat Oxyporus and Adonis, and besides them daughters, Orsedice, Laogore, and Braesia. These by reason of the wrath of Aphrodite cohabited with foreigners, and ended their life in Egypt.

[4] Ἄδωνις δὲ ἔτι παῖς ὢν Ἀρτέμιδος χόλῳ πληγεὶς ἐν θήρᾳ ὑπὸ συὸς ἀπέθανεν. Ἡσίοδος δὲ αὐτὸν Φοίνικος καὶ Ἀλφεσιβοίας λέγει, Πανύασις δέ φησι Θείαντος βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων, ὃς ἔσχε θυγατέρα Σμύρναν. αὕτη κατὰ μῆνιν Ἀφροδίτης （οὐ γὰρ αὐτὴν ἐτίμα） ἴσχει τοῦ πατρὸς ἔρωτα, καὶ συνεργὸν λαβοῦσα τὴν τροφὸν ἀγνοοῦντι τῷ πατρὶ νύκτας δώδεκα συνευνάσθη. ὁ δὲ ὡς ᾔσθετο, σπασάμενος τὸ ξίφος ἐδίωκεν αὐτήν: ἡ δὲ περικαταλαμβανομένη θεοῖς ηὔξατο ἀφανὴς γενέσθαι. θεοὶ δὲ κατοικτείραντες αὐτὴν εἰς δένδρον μετήλλαξαν, ὃ καλοῦσι σμύρναν. δεκαμηνιαίῳ δὲ ὕστερον χρόνῳ τοῦ δένδρου ῥαγέντος γεννηθῆναι τὸν λεγόμενον Ἄδωνιν, ὃν Ἀφροδίτη διὰ κάλλος ἔτι νήπιον κρύφα θεῶν εἰς λάρνακα κρύψασα Περσεφόνῃ παρίστατο. ἐκείνη δὲ ὡς ἐθεάσατο, οὐκ ἀπεδίδου. κρίσεως δὲ ἐπὶ Διὸς γενομένης εἰς τρεῖς μοίρας διῃρέθη ὁ ἐνιαυτός, καὶ μίαν μὲν παρ᾽ ἑαυτῷ μένειν τὸν Ἄδωνιν, μίαν δὲ παρὰ Περσεφόνῃ προσέταξε, τὴν δὲ ἑτέραν παρ᾽ Ἀφροδίτῃ: ὁ δὲ Ἄδωνις ταύτῃ προσένειμε καὶ τὴν ἰδίαν μοῖραν. ὕστερον δὲ θηρεύων Ἄδωνις ὑπὸ συὸς πληγεὶς ἀπέθανε.

[4] And Adonis, while still a boy, was wounded and killed in hunting by a boar through the anger of Artemis. Hesiod, however, affirms that he was a son of Phoenix and Alphesiboea; and Panyasis says that he was a son of Thias, king of Assyria, who had a daughter Smyrna. In consequence of the wrath of Aphrodite, for she did not honor the goddess, this Smyrna conceived a passion for her father, and with the complicity of her nurse she shared her father’s bed without his knowledge for twelve nights. But when he was aware of it, he drew his sword and pursued her, and being overtaken she prayed to the gods that she might be invisible; so the gods in compassion turned her into the tree which they call smyrna （ myrrh）. Ten months afterwards the tree burst and Adonis, as he is called, was born, whom for the sake of his beauty, while he was still an infant, Aphrodite hid in a chest unknown to the gods and entrusted to Persephone. But when Persephone beheld him, she would not give him back. The case being tried before Zeus, the year was divided into three parts, and the god ordained that Adonis should stay by himself for one part of the year, with Persephone for one part, and with Aphrodite for the remainder. However Adonis made over to Aphrodite his own share in addition; but afterwards in hunting he was gored and killed by a boar.

[5] Κέκροπος δὲ ἀποθανόντος Κραναὸς ἐβασίλευσεν αὐτόχθων ὤν, ἐφ᾽ οὗ τὸν ἐπὶ Δευκαλίωνος λέγεται κατακλυσμὸν γενέσθαι. οὗτος γήμας ἐκ Λακεδαίμονος Πεδιάδα τὴν Μύνητος ἐγέννησε Κρανάην καὶ Κραναίχμην καὶ Ἀτθίδα, ἧς ἀποθανούσης ἔτι παρθένου τὴν χώραν Κραναὸς Ἀτθίδα προσηγόρευσε.

[5] When Cecrops died, Cranaus came to the throne; he was a son of the soil, and it was in his time that the flood in the age of Deucalion is said to have taken place. He married a Lacedaemonian wife, Pedias, daughter of Mynes, and begat Cranae, Menaechme, and Atthis; and when Atthis died a maid, Cranaus called the country Atthis.

[6] Κραναὸν δὲ ἐκβαλὼν Ἀμφικτύων ἐβασίλευσε: τοῦτον ἔνιοι μὲν Δευκαλίωνος, ἔνιοι δὲ αὐτόχθονα λέγουσι. βασιλεύσαντα δὲ αὐτὸν ἔτη δώδεκα Ἐριχθόνιος ἐκβάλλει. τοῦτον οἱ μὲν Ἡφαίστου καὶ τῆς Κραναοῦ θυγατρὸς Ἀτθίδος εἶναι λέγουσιν, οἱ δὲ Ἡφαίστου καὶ Ἀθηνᾶς, οὕτως: Ἀθηνᾶ παρεγένετο πρὸς Ἥφαιστον, ὅπλα κατασκευάσαι θέλουσα. ὁ δὲ ἐγκαταλελειμμένος ὑπὸ Ἀφροδίτης εἰς ἐπιθυμίαν ὤλισθε τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς, καὶ διώκειν αὐτὴν ἤρξατο: ἡ δὲ ἔφευγεν. ὡς δὲ ἐγγὺς αὐτῆς ἐγένετο πολλῇ ἀνάγκῃ （ἦν γὰρ χωλός）, ἐπειρᾶτο συνελθεῖν. ἡ δὲ ὡς σώφρων καὶ παρθένος οὖσα οὐκ ἠνέσχετο: ὁ δὲ ἀπεσπέρμηνεν εἰς τὸ σκέλος τῆς θεᾶς. ἐκείνη δὲ μυσαχθεῖσα ἐρίῳ ἀπομάξασα τὸν γόνον εἰς γῆν ἔρριψε. φευγούσης δὲ αὐτῆς καὶ τῆς γονῆς εἰς γῆν πεσούσης Ἐριχθόνιος γίνεται. τοῦτον Ἀθηνᾶ κρύφα τῶν ἄλλων θεῶν ἔτρεφεν, ἀθάνατον θέλουσα ποιῆσαι: καὶ καταθεῖσα αὐτὸν εἰς κίστην Πανδρόσῳ τῇ Κέκροπος παρακατέθετο, ἀπειποῦσα τὴν κίστην ἀνοίγειν. αἱ δὲ ἀδελφαὶ τῆς Πανδρόσου ἀνοίγουσιν ὑπὸ περιεργίας, καὶ θεῶνται τῷ βρέφει παρεσπειραμένον δράκοντα: καὶ ὡς μὲν ἔνιοι λέγουσιν, ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ διεφθάρησαν τοῦ δράκοντος, ὡς δὲ ἔνιοι, δι᾽ ὀργὴν Ἀθηνᾶς ἐμμανεῖς γενόμεναι κατὰ τῆς ἀκροπόλεως αὑτὰς ἔρριψαν. ἐν δὲ τῷ τεμένει τραφεὶς Ἐριχθόνιος ὑπ᾽ αὐτῆς Ἀθηνᾶς, ἐκβαλὼν Ἀμφικτύονα ἐβασίλευσεν Ἀθηνῶν, καὶ τὸ ἐν ἀκροπόλει ξόανον τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς ἱδρύσατο, καὶ τῶν Παναθηναίων τὴν ἑορτὴν συνεστήσατο, καὶ Πραξιθέαν νηίδα νύμφην ἔγημεν, ἐξ ἧς αὐτῷ παῖς Πανδίων ἐγεννήθη.

[6] Cranaus was expelled by Amphictyon, who reigned in his stead; some say that Amphictyon was a son of Deucalion, others that he was a son of the soil; and when he had reigned twelve years he was expelled by Erichthonius. Some say that this Erichthonius was a son of Hephaestus and Atthis, daughter of Cranaus, and some that he was a son of Hephaestus and Athena, as follows: Athena came to Hephaestus, desirous of fashioning arms. But he, being forsaken by Aphrodite, fell in love with Athena, and began to pursue her; but she fled. When he got near her with much ado （ for he was lame）, he attempted to embrace her; but she, being a chaste virgin, would not submit to him, and he dropped his seed on the leg of the goddess. In disgust, she wiped off the seed with wool and threw it on the ground; and as she fled and the seed fell on the ground, Erichthonius was produced. Him Athena brought up unknown to the other gods, wishing to make him immortal; and having put him in a chest, she committed it to Pandrosus, daughter of Cecrops, forbidding her to open the chest. But the sisters of Pandrosus opened it out of curiosity, and beheld a serpent coiled about the babe; and, as some say, they were destroyed by the serpent, but according to others they were driven mad by reason of the anger of Athena and threw themselves down from the acropolis. Having been brought up by Athena herself in the precinct, Erichthonius expelled Amphictyon and became king of Athens; and he set up the wooden image of Athena in the acropolis, and instituted the festival of the Panathenaea, and married Praxithea, a Naiad nymph, by whom he had a son Pandion.

[7] Ἐριχθονίου δὲ ἀποθανόντος καὶ ταφέντος ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ τεμένει τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς Πανδίων ἐβασίλευσεν, ἐφ᾽ οὗ Δημήτηρ καὶ Διόνυσος εἰς τὴν Ἀττικὴν ἦλθον. ἀλλὰ Δήμητρα μὲν Κελεὸς εἰς τὴν Ἐλευσῖνα ὑπεδέξατο, Διόνυσον δὲ Ἰκάριος: ὃς λαμβάνει παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ κλῆμα ἀμπέλου καὶ τὰ περὶ τὴν οἰνοποιίαν μανθάνει. καὶ τὰς τοῦ θεοῦ δωρήσασθαι θέλων χάριτας ἀνθρώποις, ἀφικνεῖται πρός τινας ποιμένας, οἳ γευσάμενοι τοῦ ποτοῦ καὶ χωρὶς ὕδατος δι᾽ ἡδονὴν ἀφειδῶς ἑλκύσαντες, πεφαρμάχθαι νομίζοντες ἀπέκτειναν αὐτόν. μεθ᾽ ἡμέραν δὲ νοήσαντες ἔθαψαν αὐτόν. Ἠριγόνῃ δὲ τῇ θυγατρὶ τὸν πατέρα μαστευούσῃ κύων συνήθης ὄνομα Μαῖρα, ἣ τῷ Ἰκαρίῳ συνείπετο, τὸν νεκρὸν ἐμήνυσε: κἀκείνη κατοδυραμένη τὸν πατέρα ἑαυτὴν ἀνήρτησε.

[7] When Erichthonius died and was buried in the same precinct of Athena, Pandion became king, in whose time Demeter and Dionysus came to Attica. But Demeter was welcomed by Celeus at Eleusis, and Dionysus by Icarius, who received from him a branch of a vine and learned the process of making wine. And wishing to bestow the god’s boons on men, Icarius went to some shepherds, who, having tasted the beverage and quaffed it copiously without water for the pleasure of it, imagined that they were bewitched and killed him; but by day they understood how it was and buried him. When his daughter Erigone was searching for her father, a domestic dog, named Maera, which had attended Icarius, discovered his dead body to her, and she bewailed her father and hanged herself.

[8] Πανδίων δὲ γήμας Ζευξίππην τῆς μητρὸς τὴν ἀδελφὴν θυγατέρας μὲν ἐτέκνωσε Πρόκνην καὶ Φιλομήλαν, παῖδας δὲ διδύμους Ἐρεχθέα καὶ Βούτην. πολέμου δὲ ἐνστάντος πρὸς Λάβδακον περὶ γῆς ὅρων ἐπεκαλέσατο βοηθὸν ἐκ Θρᾴκης Τηρέα τὸν Ἄρεος, καὶ τὸν πόλεμον σὺν αὐτῷ κατορθώσας ἔδωκε Τηρεῖ πρὸς γάμον τὴν ἑαυτοῦ θυγατέρα Πρόκνην. ὁ δὲ ἐκ ταύτης γεννήσας παῖδα Ἴτυν, καὶ Φιλομήλας ἐρασθεὶς ἔφθειρε καὶ ταύτην, εἰπὼν τεθνάναι Πρόκνην, κρύπτων ἐπὶ τῶν χωρίων. αὖθις δὲ γήμας Φιλομήλαν συνηυνάζετο, καὶ τὴν γλῶσσαν ἐξέτεμεν αὐτῆς. ἡ δὲ ὑφήνασα ἐν πέπλῳ γράμματα διὰ τούτων ἐμήνυσε Πρόκνῃ τὰς ἰδίας συμφοράς. ἡ δὲ ἀναζητήσασα τὴν ἀδελφὴν κτείνει τὸν παῖδα Ἴτυν, καὶ καθεψήσασα Τηρεῖ δεῖπνον ἀγνοοῦντι παρατίθησι: καὶ μετὰ τῆς ἀδελφῆς διὰ τάχους ἔφυγε. Τηρεὺς δὲ αἰσθόμενος, ἁρπάσας πέλεκυν ἐδίωκεν. αἱ δὲ ἐν Δαυλίᾳ τῆς Φωκίδος γινόμεναι περικατάληπτοι θεοῖς εὔχονται ἀπορνεωθῆναι, καὶ Πρόκνη μὲν γίνεται ἀηδών, Φιλομήλα δὲ χελιδών: ἀπορνεοῦται δὲ καὶ Τηρεύς, καὶ γίνεται ἔποψ.

[8] Pandion married Zeuxippe, his mother’s sister, and begat two daughters, Procne and Philomela, and twin sons, Erechtheus and Butes. But war having broken out with Labdacus on a question of boundaries, he called in the help of Tereus, son of Ares, from Thrace, and having with his help brought the war to a successful close, he gave Tereus his own daughter Procne in marriage. Tereus had by her a son Itys, and having fallen in love with Philomela, he seduced her also saying that Procne was dead, for he concealed her in the country. Afterwards he married Philomela and bedded with her, and cut out her tongue. But by weaving characters in a robe she revealed thereby to Procne her own sorrows. And having sought out her sister, Procne killed her son Itys, boiled him, served him up for supper to the unwitting Tereus, and fled with her sister in haste. When Tereus was aware of what had happened, he snatched up an axe and pursued them. And being overtaken at Daulia in Phocis, they prayed the gods to be turned into birds, and Procne became a nightingale, and Philomela a swallow. And Tereus also was changed into a bird and became a hoopoe.

[1] Πανδίονος δὲ ἀποθανόντος οἱ παῖδες τὰ πατρῷα ἐμερίσαντο, καὶ τὴν μὲν βασιλείαν Ἐρεχθεὺς λαμβάνει, τὴν δὲ ἱερωσύνην τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς καὶ τοῦ Ποσειδῶνος τοῦ Ἐρεχθέως Βούτης. γήμας δὲ Ἐρεχθεὺς Πραξιθέαν τὴν Φρασίμου καὶ Διογενείας τῆς Κηφισοῦ, ἔσχε παῖδας Κέκροπα Πάνδωρον Μητίονα, θυγατέρας δὲ Πρόκριν Κρέουσαν Χθονίαν Ὠρείθυιαν, ἣν ἥρπασε Βορέας.Χθονίαν μὲν οὖν ἔγημε Βούτης, Κρέουσαν δὲ Ξοῦθος, Πρόκριν δὲ Κέφαλος ὁ Δηιόνος. ἡ δὲ λαβοῦσα χρυσοῦν στέφανον Πτελέοντι συνευνάζεται, καὶ φωραθεῖσα ὑπὸ Κεφάλου πρὸς Μίνωα φεύγει. ὁ δὲ αὐτῆς ἐρᾷ καὶ πείθει συνελθεῖν. εἰ δὲ συνέλθοι γυνὴ Μίνωι, ἀδύνατον ἦν αὐτὴν σωθῆναι: Πασιφάη γάρ, ἐπειδὴ πολλαῖς Μίνως συνηυνάζετο γυναιξίν, ἐφαρμάκευσεν αὐτόν, καὶ ὁπότε ἄλλῃ συνηυνάζετο, εἰς τὰ ἄρθρα ἀφίει θηρία, καὶ οὕτως ἀπώλλυντο. ἔχοντος οὖν αὐτοῦ κύνα ταχὺν καὶ ἀκόντιον ἰθυβόλον, ἐπὶ τούτοις Πρόκρις, δοῦσα τὴν Κιρκαίαν πιεῖν ῥίζαν πρὸς τὸ μηδὲν βλάψαι, συνευνάζεται. δείσασα δὲ αὖθις τὴν Μίνωος γυναῖκα ἧκεν εἰς Ἀθήνας, καὶ διαλλαγεῖσα Κεφάλῳ μετὰ τούτου παραγίνεται ἐπὶ θήραν: ἦν γὰρ θηρευτική. διωκούσης δὲ αὐτῆς ἐν τῇ λόχμῃ ἀγνοήσας Κέφαλος ἀκοντίζει, καὶ τυχὼν ἀποκτείνει Πρόκριν. καὶ κριθεὶς ἐν Ἀρείῳ πάγῳ φυγὴν ἀίδιον καταδικάζεται.

[1] When Pandion died, his sons divided their father’s inheritance between them, and Erechtheus got the kingdom, and Butes got the priesthood of Athena and Poseidon Erechtheus. Erechtheus married Praxithea, daughter of Phrasimus by Diogenia, daughter of Cephisus, and had sons, to wit, Cecrops, Pandorus, and Metion; and daughters, to wit, Procris, Creusa, Chthonia, and Orithyia, who was carried off by Boreas.Chthonia was married to Butes, Creusa to Xuthus, and Procris to Cephalus, son of Deion. Bribed by a golden crown, Procris admitted Pteleon to her bed, and being detected by Cephalus she fled to Minos. But he fell in love with her and tried to seduce her. Now if any woman had intercourse with Minos, it was impossible for her to escape with life; for because Minos cohabited with many women, Pasiphae bewitched him, and whenever he took another woman to his bed, he discharged wild beasts at her joints, and so the women perished. But Minos had a swift dog and a dart that flew straight; and in return for these gifts Procris shared his bed, having first given him the Circaean root to drink that he might not harm her. But afterwards, fearing the wife of Minos, she came to Athens and being reconciled to Cephalus she went forth with him to the chase; for she was fond of hunting. As she was in pursuit of game in the thicket, Cephalus, not knowing she was there, threw a dart, hit and killed Procris, and, being tried in the Areopagus, was condemned to perpetual banishment.

[2] Ὠρείθυιαν δὲ παίζουσαν ἐπὶ Ἰλισσοῦ ποταμοῦ ἁρπάσας Βορέας συνῆλθεν: ἡ δὲ γεννᾷ θυγατέρας μὲν Κλεοπάτραν καὶ Χιόνην, υἱοὺς δὲ Ζήτην καὶ Κάλαϊν πτερωτούς, οἳ πλέοντες σὺν Ἰάσονι καὶ τὰς ἁρπυίας διώκοντες ἀπέθανον, ὡς δὲ Ἀκουσίλαος λέγει, περὶ Τῆνον ὑφ᾽ Ἡρακλέους ἀπώλοντο.

[2] While Orithyia was playing by the Ilissus river, Boreas carried her off and had intercourse with her; and she bore daughters, Cleopatra and Chione, and winged sons, Zetes and Calais. These sons sailed with Jason and met their end in chasing the Harpies; but according to Acusilaus, they were killed by Hercules in Tenos.

[3] Κλεοπάτραν δὲ ἔγημε Φινεύς, ᾧ γίνονται παῖδες ἐξ αὐτῆς Πλήξιππος καὶ Πανδίων. ἔχων δὲ τούτους ἐκ Κλεοπάτρας παῖδας Ἰδαίαν ἐγάμει τὴν Δαρδάνου. κἀκείνη τῶν προγόνων πρὸς Φινέα φθορὰν καταψεύδεται, καὶ πιστεύσας Φινεὺς ἀμφοτέρους τυφλοῖ. παραπλέοντες δὲ οἱ Ἀργοναῦται σὺν Βορέᾳ κολάζονται αὐτόν.

[3] Cleopatra was married to Phineus, who had by her two sons, Plexippus and Pandion. When he had these sons by Cleopatra, he married Idaea, daughter of Dardanus. She falsely accused her stepsons to Phineus of corrupting her virtue, and Phineus, believing her, blinded them both. But when the Argonauts sailed past with Boreas, they punished him.

[4] Χιόνη δὲ Ποσειδῶνι μίγνυται. ἡ δὲ κρύφα τοῦ πατρὸς Εὔμολπον τεκοῦσα, ἵνα μὴ γένηται καταφανής, εἰς τὸν βυθὸν ῥίπτει τὸ παιδίον. Ποσειδῶν δὲ ἀνελόμενος εἰς Αἰθιοπίαν κομίζει καὶ δίδωσι Βενθεσικύμῃ τρέφειν, αὐτοῦ θυγατρὶ καὶ Ἀμφιτρίτης. ὡς δὲ ἐτελειώθη, ὁ Βενθεσικύμης ἀνὴρ τὴν ἑτέραν αὐτῷ τῶν θυγατέρων δίδωσιν. ὁ δὲ καὶ τὴν ἀδελφὴν τῆς γαμηθείσης ἐπεχείρησε βιάζεσθαι, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο φυγαδευθεὶς μετὰ Ἰσμάρου τοῦ παιδὸς πρὸς Τεγύριον ἧκε, Θρᾳκῶν βασιλέα, ὃς αὐτοῦ τῷ παιδὶ τὴν θυγατέρα συνῴκισεν. ἐπιβουλεύων δὲ ὕστερον Τεγυρίῳ καταφανὴς γίνεται, καὶ πρὸς Ἐλευσινίους φεύγει καὶ φιλίαν ποιεῖται πρὸς αὐτούς. αὖθις δὲ Ἰσμάρου τελευτήσαντος μεταπεμφθεὶς ὑπὸ Τεγυρίου παραγίνεται, καὶ τὴν πρὸ τοῦ μάχην διαλυσάμενος τὴν βασιλείαν παρέλαβε. καὶ πολέμου ἐνστάντος πρὸς Ἀθηναίους τοῖς Ἐλευσινίοις, ἐπικληθεὶς ὑπὸ Ἐλευσινίων μετὰ πολλῆς συνεμάχει Θρᾳκῶν δυνάμεως. Ἐρεχθεῖ δὲ ὑπὲρ Ἀθηναίων νίκης χρωμένῳ ἔχρησεν ὁ θεὸς κατορθώσειν τὸν πόλεμον, ἐὰν μίαν τῶν θυγατέρων σφάξῃ. καὶ σφάξαντος αὐτοῦ τὴν νεωτάτην καὶ αἱ λοιπαὶ ἑαυτὰς κατέσφαξαν: ἐπεποίηντο γάρ, ὡς ἔφασάν τινες, συνωμοσίαν ἀλλήλαις συναπολέσθαι. γενομένης δὲ μετὰ τὴν σφαγὴν τῆς μάχης Ἐρεχθεὺς μὲν ἀνεῖλεν Εὔμολπον,

[4] Chione had connexion with Poseidon, and having given birth to Eumolpus unknown to her father, in order not to be detected, she flung the child into the deep. But Poseidon picked him up and conveyed him to Ethiopia, and gave him to Benthesicyme（ a daughter of his own by Amphitrite） to bring up. When he was full grown, Benthesicyme’s husband gave him one of his two daughters. But he tried to force his wife’s sister, and being banished on that account, he went with his son Ismarus to Tegyrius, king of Thrace, who gave his daughter in marriage to Eumolpus’s son. But being afterwards detected in a plot against Tegyrius, he fled to the Eleusinians and made friends with them. Later, on the death of Ismarus, he was sent for by Tegyrius and went, composed his old feud with him, and succeeded to the kingdom. And war having broken out between the Athenians and the Eleusinians, he was called in by the Eleusinians and fought on their side with a large force of Thracians. When Erechtheus inquired of the oracle how the Athenians might be victorious, the god answered that they would win the war if he would slaughter one of his daughters; and when he slaughtered his youngest, the others also slaughtered themselves; for, as some said, they had taken an oath among themselves to perish together. In the battle which took place after the slaughter, Erechtheus killed Eumolpus.

[5] Ποσειδῶνος δὲ καὶ τὸν Ἐρεχθέα καὶ τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ καταλύσαντος, Κέκροψ ὁ πρεσβύτατος τῶν Ἐρεχθέως παίδων ἐβασίλευσεν, ὃς γήμας Μητιάδουσαν τὴν Εὐπαλάμου παῖδα ἐτέκνωσε Πανδίονα. οὗτος μετὰ Κέκροπα βασιλεύων ὑπὸ τῶν Μητίονος υἱῶν κατὰ στάσιν ἐξεβλήθη, καὶ παραγενόμενος εἰς Μέγαρα πρὸς Πύλαν τὴν ἐκείνου θυγατέρα Πυλίαν γαμεῖ. αὖθις δὲ καὶ τῆς πόλεως βασιλεὺς καθίσταται: κτείνας γὰρ Πύλας τὸν τοῦ πατρὸς ἀδελφὸν Βίαντα τὴν βασιλείαν δίδωσι Πανδίονι, αὐτὸς δὲ εἰς Πελοπόννησον σὺν λαῷ παραγενόμενος κτίζει πόλιν Πύλον.Πανδίονι δὲ ἐν Μεγάροις ὄντι παῖδες ἐγένοντο Αἰγεὺς Πάλλας Νῖσος Λύκος. ἔνιοι δὲ Αἰγέα Σκυρίου εἶναι λέγουσιν, ὑποβληθῆναι δὲ ὑπὸ Πανδίονος.

[5] But Poseidon having destroyed Erechtheus and his house, Cecrops, the eldest of the sons of Erechtheus, succeeded to the throne. He married Metiadusa, daughter of Eupalamus, and begat Pandion. This Pandion, reigning after Cecrops, was expelled by the sons of Metion in a sedition, and going to Pylas at Megara married his daughter Pylia. And at a later time he was even appointed king of the city; for Pylas slew his father’s brother Bias and gave the kingdom to Pandion, while he himself repaired to Peloponnese with a body of people and founded the city of Pylus.While Pandion was at Megara, he had sons born to him, to wit, Aegeus, Pallas, Nisus, and Lycus. But some say that Aegeus was a son of Scyrius, but was passed off by Pandion as his own.

[6] μετὰ δὲ τὴν Πανδίονος τελευτὴν οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ στρατεύσαντες ἐπ᾽ Ἀθήνας ἐξέβαλον τοὺς Μητιονίδας καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν τετραχῇ διεῖλον: εἶχε δὲ τὸ πᾶν κράτος Αἰγεύς. γαμεῖ δὲ πρώτην μὲν Μήταν τὴν Ὁπλῆτος, δευτέραν δὲ Χαλκιόπην τὴν Ῥηξήνορος. ὡς δὲ οὐκ ἐγένετο παῖς αὐτῷ, δεδοικὼς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς εἰς Πυθίαν ἦλθε καὶ περὶ παίδων γονῆς ἐμαντεύετο. ὁ δὲ θεὸς ἔχρησεν αὐτῷ: “ἀσκοῦ τὸν προύχοντα ποδάονα, φέρτατε λαῶν,μὴ λύσῃς, πρὶν ἐς ἄκρον Ἀθηναίων ἀφίκηαι.” ἀπορῶν δὲ τὸν χρησμὸν ἀνῄει πάλιν εἰς Ἀθήνας.

[6] After the death of Pandion his sons marched against Athens, expelled the Metionids, and divided the government in four; but Aegeus had the whole power. The first wife whom he married was Meta, daughter of Hoples, and the second was Chalciope, daughter of Rhexenor. As no child was born to him, he feared his brothers, and went to Pythia and consulted the oracle concerning the begetting of children. The god answered him:” The bulging mouth of the wineskin, O best of men,
Loose not until thou hast reached the height of Athens.
“ Not knowing what to make of the oracle, he set out on his return to Athens.

[7] καὶ Τροιζῆνα διοδεύων ἐπιξενοῦται Πιτθεῖ τῷ Πέλοπος, ὃς τὸν χρησμὸν συνείς, μεθύσας αὐτὸν τῇ θυγατρὶ συγκατέκλινεν Αἴθρᾳ. τῇ δὲ αὐτῇ νυκτὶ καὶ Ποσειδῶν ἐπλησίασεν αὐτῇ. Αἰγεὺς δὲ ἐντειλάμενος Αἴθρᾳ, ἐὰν ἄρρενα γεννήσῃ, τρέφειν, τίνος ἐστὶ μὴ λέγουσαν, ἀπέλιπεν ὑπό τινα πέτραν μάχαιραν καὶ πέδιλα, εἰπών, ὅταν ὁ παῖς δύνηται τὴν πέτραν ἀποκυλίσας ἀνελέσθαι ταῦτα, τότε μετ᾽ αὐτῶν αὐτὸν ἀποπέμπειν.αὐτὸς δὲ ἧκεν εἰς Ἀθήνας, καὶ τὸν τῶν Παναθηναίων ἀγῶνα ἐπετέλει, ἐν ᾧ ὁ Μίνωος παῖς Ἀνδρόγεως ἐνίκησε πάντας. τοῦτον Αἰγεὺς ἐπὶ τὸν Μαραθώνιον ἔπεμψε ταῦρον, ὑφ᾽ οὗ διεφθάρη. ἔνιοι δὲ αὐτὸν λέγουσι πορευόμενον εἰς Θήβας ἐπὶ τὸν Λαΐου ἀγῶνα πρὸς τῶν ἀγωνιστῶν ἐνεδρευθέντα διὰ φθόνον ἀπολέσθαι. Μίνως δέ, ἀγγελθέντος αὐτῷ τοῦ θανάτου, θύων ἐν Πάρῳ ταῖς χάρισι, τὸν μὲν στέφανον ἀπὸ τῆς κεφαλῆς ἔρριψε καὶ τὸν αὐλὸν κατέσχε, τὴν δὲ θυσίαν οὐδὲν ἧττον ἐπετέλεσεν: ὅθεν ἔτι καὶ δεῦρο χωρὶς αὐλῶν καὶ στεφάνων ἐν Πάρῳ θύουσι ταῖς χάρισι.

[7] And journeying by way of Troezen, he lodged with Pittheus, son of Pelops, who, understanding the oracle, made him drunk and caused him to lie with his daughter Aethra. But in the same night Poseidon also had connexion with her. Now Aegeus charged Aethra that, if she gave birth to a male child, she should rear it, without telling whose it was; and he left a sword and sandals under a certain rock, saying that when the boy could roll away the rock and take them up, she was then to send him away with them.But he himself came to Athens and celebrated the games of the Panathenian festival, in which Androgeus, son of Minos, vanquished all comers. Him Aegeus sent against the bull of Marathon, by which he was destroyed. But some say that as he journeyed to Thebes to take part in the games in honor of Laius, he was waylaid and murdered by the jealous competitors. But when the tidings of his death were brought to Minos, as he was sacrificing to the Graces in Paros, he threw away the garland from his head and stopped the music of the flute, but nevertheless completed the sacrifice; hence down to this day they sacrifice to the Graces in Paros without flutes and garlands.

[8] μετ᾽ οὐ πολὺ δὲ θαλασσοκρατῶν ἐπολέμησε στόλῳ τὰς Ἀθήνας, καὶ Μέγαρα εἷλε Νίσου βασιλεύοντος τοῦ Πανδίονος, καὶ Μεγαρέα τὸν Ἱππομένους ἐξ Ὀγχηστοῦ Νίσῳ βοηθὸν ἐλθόντα ἀπέκτεινεν. ἀπέθανε δὲ καὶ Νῖσος διὰ θυγατρὸς προδοσίαν. ἔχοντι γὰρ αὐτῷ πορφυρέαν ἐν μέσῃ τῇ κεφαλῇ τρίχα ταύτης ἀφαιρεθείσης ἦν χρησμὸς τελευτῆσαι: ἡ δὲ θυγάτηρ αὐτοῦ Σκύλλα ἐρασθεῖσα Μίνωος ἐξεῖλε τὴν τρίχα. Μίνως δὲ Μεγάρων κρατήσας καὶ τὴν κόρην τῆς πρύμνης τῶν ποδῶν ἐκδήσας ὑποβρύχιον ἐποίησε.χρονιζομένου δὲ τοῦ πολέμου, μὴ δυνάμενος ἑλεῖν Ἀθήνας εὔχεται Διὶ παρ᾽ Ἀθηναίων λαβεῖν δίκας. γενομένου δὲ τῇ πόλει λιμοῦ τε καὶ λοιμοῦ. τὸ μὲν πρῶτον κατὰ λόγιον Ἀθηναῖοι παλαιὸν τὰς Ὑακίνθου κόρας, Ἀνθηίδα Αἰγληίδα Λυταίαν Ὀρθαίαν, ἐπὶ τὸν Γεραίστου τοῦ Κύκλωπος τάφον κατέσφαξαν: τούτων δὲ ὁ πατὴρ Ὑάκινθος ἐλθὼν ἐκ Λακεδαίμονος Ἀθήνας κατῴκει. ὡς δὲ οὐδὲν ὄφελος ἦν τοῦτο, ἐχρῶντο περὶ ἀπαλλαγῆς. ὁ δὲ θεὸς ἀνεῖλεν αὐτοῖς Μίνωι διδόναι δίκας ἃς ἂν αὐτὸς αἱροῖτο. πέμψαντες οὖν πρὸς Μίνωα ἐπέτρεπον αἰτεῖν δίκας. Μίνως δὲ ἐκέλευσεν αὐτοῖς κόρους ἑπτὰ καὶ κόρας τὰς ἴσας χωρὶς ὅπλων πέμπειν τῷ Μινωταύρῳ βοράν. ἦν δὲ οὗτος ἐν λαβυρίνθῳ καθειργμένος, ἐν ᾧ τὸν εἰσελθόντα ἀδύνατον ἦν ἐξιέναι: πολυπλόκοις γὰρ καμπαῖς τὴν ἀγνοουμένην ἔξοδον ἀπέκλειε. κατεσκευάκει δὲ αὐτὸν Δαίδαλος ὁ Εὐπαλάμου παῖς τοῦ Μητίονος καὶ Ἀλκίππης. ἦν γὰρ ἀρχιτέκτων ἄριστος καὶ πρῶτος ἀγαλμάτων εὑρετής. οὗτος ἐξ Ἀθηνῶν ἔφυγεν, ἀπὸ τῆς ἀκροπόλεως βαλὼν τὸν τῆς ἀδελφῆς Πέρδικος υἱὸν Τάλω, μαθητὴν ὄντα, δείσας μὴ διὰ τὴν εὐφυΐαν αὐτὸν ὑπερβάλῃ: σιαγόνα γὰρ ὄφεως εὑρὼν ξύλον λεπτὸν ἔπρισε. φωραθέντος δὲ τοῦ νεκροῦ κριθεὶς ἐν Ἀρείῳ πάγῳ καὶ καταδικασθεὶς πρὸς Μίνωα ἔφυγε. κἀκεῖ Πασιφάῃ ἐρασθείσῃ τοῦ Ποσειδωνείου ταύρου συνήργησε τεχνησάμενος ξυλίνην βοῦν, καὶ τὸν λαβύρινθον κατεσκεύασεν, εἰς ὃν κατὰ ἔτος Ἀθηναῖοι κόρους ἑπτὰ καὶ κόρας τὰς ἴσας τῷ Μινωταύρῳ βορὰν ἔπεμπον.

[8] But not long afterwards, being master of the sea, he attacked Athens with a fleet and captured Megara, then ruled by king Nisus, son of Pandion, and he slew Megareus, son of Hippomenes, who had come from Onchestus to the help of Nisus. Now Nisus perished through his daughter’s treachery. For he had a purple hair on the middle of his head, and an oracle ran that when it was pulled out he should die; and his daughter Scylla fell in love with Minos and pulled out the hair. But when Minos had made himself master of Megara, he tied the damsel by the feet to the stern of the ship and drowned her.When the war lingered on and he could not take Athens, he prayed to Zeus that he might be avenged on the Athenians. And the city being visited with a famine and a pestilence, the Athenians at first, in obedience to an ancient oracle, slaughtered the daughters of Hyacinth, to wit, Antheis, Aegleis, Lytaea, and Orthaea, on the grave of Geraestus, the Cyclops; now Hyacinth, the father of the damsels, had come from Lacedaemon and dwelt in Athens. But when this was of no avail, they inquired of the oracle how they could be delivered; and the god answered them that they should give Minos whatever satisfaction he might choose. So they sent to Minos and left it to him to claim satisfaction. And Minos ordered them to send seven youths and the same number of damsels without weapons to be fodder for the Minotaur. Now the Minotaur was confined in a labyrinth, in which he who entered could not find his way out; for many a winding turn shut off the secret outward way. The labyrinth was constructed by Daedalus, whose father was Eupalamus, son of Metion, and whose mother was Alcippe; for he was an excellent architect and the first inventor of images. He had fled from Athens, because he had thrown down from the acropolis Talos, the son of his sister Perdix; for Talos was his pupil, and Daedalus feared that with his talents he might surpass himself, seeing that he had sawed a thin stick with a jawbone of a snake which he had found. But the corpse was discovered; Daedalus was tried in the Areopagus, and being condemned fled to Minos. And there Pasiphae having fallen in love with the bull of Poseidon, Daedalus acted as her accomplice by contriving a wooden cow, and he constructed the labyrinth, to which the Athenians every year sent seven youths and as many damsels to be fodder for the Minotaur.

[1] Θησεὺς δὲ γεννηθεὶς ἐξ Αἴθρας Αἰγεῖ παῖς, ὡς ἐγένετο τέλειος, ἀπωσάμενος τὴν πέτραν τὰ πέδιλα καὶ τὴν μάχαιραν ἀναιρεῖται, καὶ πεζὸς ἠπείγετο εἰς τὰς Ἀθήνας. φρουρουμένην δὲ ὑπὸ ἀνδρῶν κακούργων τὴν ὁδὸν ἡμέρωσε. πρῶτον μὲν γὰρ Περιφήτην τὸν Ἡφαίστου καὶ Ἀντικλείας, ὃς ἀπὸ τῆς κορύνης ἣν ἐφόρει κορυνήτης ἐπεκαλεῖτο, ἔκτεινεν ἐν Ἐπιδαύρῳ. πόδας δὲ ἀσθενεῖς ἔχων οὗτος ἐφόρει κορύνην σιδηρᾶν, δι᾽ ἧς τοὺς παριόντας ἔκτεινε. ταύτην ἀφελόμενος Θησεὺς ἐφόρει.

[1] Aethra bore to Aegeus a son Theseus, and when he was grown up, he pushed away the rock and took up the sandals and the sword, and hastened on foot to Athens. And he cleared the road, which had been beset by evildoers. For first in Epidaurus he slew Periphetes, son of Hephaestus and Anticlia, who was surnamed the Clubman from the club which he carried. For being crazy on his legs he carried an iron club, with which he despatched the passers-by. That club Theseus wrested from him and continued to carry about.

[2] δεύτερον δὲ κτείνει Σίνιν τὸν Πολυπήμονος καὶ Συλέας τῆς Κορίνθου. οὗτος πιτυοκάμπτης ἐπεκαλεῖτο: οἰκῶν γὰρ τὸν Κορινθίων ἰσθμὸν ἠνάγκαζε τοὺς παριόντας πίτυς κάμπτοντας ἀνέχεσθαι: οἱ δὲ διὰ τὴν ἀσθένειαν οὐκ ἠδύναντο, καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν δένδρων ἀναρριπτούμενοι πανωλέθρως ἀπώλλυντο. τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ καὶ Θησεὺς Σίνιν ἀπέκτεινεν.

[2] Second, he killed Sinis, son of Polypemon and Sylea, daughter of Corinthus. This Sinis was surnamed the Pine-bender; for inhabiting the Isthmus of Corinth he used to force the passersby to keep bending pine trees; but they were too weak to do so, and being tossed up by the trees they perished miserably. In that way also Theseus killed Sinis.

## Επιτομή

[1] Third, he slew at Crommyon the sow that was called Phaea after the old woman who bred it; that sow, some say, was the offspring of Echidna and Typhon.

[2] τέταρτον ἔκτεινε Σκείρωνα τὸν Κορίνθιον τοῦ Πέλοπος, ὡς δὲ ἔνιοι Ποσειδῶνος. οὗτος ἐν τῇ Μεγαρικῇ κατέχων τὰς ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ κληθείσας πέτρας Σκειρωνίδας, ἠνάγκαζε τοὺς παριόντας νίζειν αὐτοῦ τοὺς πόδας, καὶ νίζοντας εἰς τὸν βυθὸν αὐτοὺς ἔρριπτε βορὰν ὑπερμεγέθει χελώνῃ.

[2] Fourth, he slew Sciron, the Corinthian, son of Pelops, or, as some say, of Poseidon. He in the Megarian territory held the rocks called after him Scironian, and compelled passers-by to wash his feet, and in the act of washing he kicked them into the deep to be the prey of a huge turtle.

[3] Θησεὺς δὲ ἁρπάσας αὐτὸν τῶν ποδῶν ἔρριψεν εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν. πέμπτον ἔκτεινεν ἐν Ἐλευσῖνι Κερκυόνα τὸν Βράγχου καὶ Ἀργιόπης νύμφης. οὗτος ἠνάγκαζε τοὺς παριόντας παλαίειν καὶ παλαίων ἀνῄρει: Θησεὺς δὲ αὐτὸν μετέωρον ἀράμενος ἔρραξεν εἰς γῆν.

[3] But Theseus seized him by the feet and threw him into the sea. Fifth, in Eleusis he slew Cercyon, son of Branchus and a nymph Argiope. This Cercyon compelled passers-by to wrestle, and in wrestling killed them. But Theseus lifted him up on high and dashed him to the ground.

[4] ἕκτον ἀπέκτεινε Δαμάστην, ὃν ἔνιοι Πολυπήμονα λέγουσιν. οὗτος τὴν οἴκησιν ἔχων παρ᾽ ὁδὸν ἐστόρεσε δύο κλίνας, μίαν μὲν μικράν, ἑτέραν δὲ μεγάλην, καὶ τοὺς παριόντας ἐπὶ ξένια καλῶν τοὺς μὲν βραχεῖς ἐπὶ τῆς μεγάλης κατακλίνων σφύραις ἔτυπτεν, ἵν᾽ ἐξισωθῶσι τῇ κλίνῃ, τοὺς δὲ μεγάλους ἐπὶ τῆς μικρᾶς, καὶ τὰ ὑπερέχοντα τοῦ σώματος ἀπέπριζε.καθάρας οὖν Θησεὺς τὴν ὁδὸν ἧκεν εἰς Ἀθήνας.

[4] Sixth, he slew Damastes, whom some call Polypemon. He had his dwelling beside the road, and made up two beds, one small and the other big; and offering hospitality to the passers-by, he laid the short men on the big bed and hammered them, to make them fit the bed; but the tall men he laid on the little bed and sawed off the portions of the body that projected beyond it.So, having cleared the road, Theseus came to Athens.

[5] Μήδεια δὲ Αἰγεῖ τότε συνοικοῦσα ἐπεβούλευσεν αὐτῷ, καὶ πείθει τὸν Αἰγέα φυλάττεσθαι ὡς ἐπίβουλον αὐτῷ. Αἰγεὺς δὲ τὸν ἴδιον ἀγνοῶν παῖδα, δείσας ἔπεμψεν ἐπὶ τὸν Μαραθώνιον ταῦρον.

[5] But Medea, being then wedded to Aegeus, plotted against him and persuaded Aegeus to beware of him as a traitor. And Aegeus, not knowing his own son, was afraid and sent him against the Marathonian bull.

[6] ὡς δὲ ἀνεῖλεν αὐτόν, παρὰ Μηδείας λαβὼν αὐθήμερον προσήνεγκεν αὐτῷ φάρμακον. ὁ δὲ μέλλοντος αὐτῷ τοῦ ποτοῦ προσφέρεσθαι ἐδωρήσατο τῷ πατρὶ τὸ ξίφος, ὅπερ ἐπιγνοὺς Αἰγεὺς τὴν κύλικα ἐξέρριψε τῶν χειρῶν αὐτοῦ. Θησεὺς δὲ ἀναγνωρισθεὶς τῷ πατρὶ καὶ τὴν ἐπιβουλὴν μαθὼν ἐξέβαλε τὴν Μήδειαν.

[6] And when Theseus had killed it, Aegeus presented to him a poison which he had received the selfsame day from Medea. But just as the draught was about to be administered to him, he gave his father the sword, and on recognizing it Aegeus dashed the cup from his hands. And when Theseus was thus made known to his father and informed of the plot, he expelled Medea.

[7] καὶ εἰς τὸν τρίτον δασμὸν τῷ Μινωταύρῳ συγκαταλέγεταιὡς δέ τινες λέγουσιν, ἑκὼν ἑαυτὸν ἔδωκεν. ἐχούσης δὲ τῆς νεὼς μέλαν ἱστίον Αἰγεὺς τῷ παιδὶ ἐνετείλατο, ἐὰν ὑποστρέφῃ ζῶν, λευκοῖς πετάσαι τὴν ναῦν ἱστίοις.

[7] And he was numbered among those who were to be sent as the third tribute to the Minotaur; or, as some affirm, he offered himself voluntarily. And as the ship had a black sail, Aegeus charged his son, if he returned alive, to spread white sails on the ship.

[8] ὡς δὲ ἧκεν εἰς Κρήτην, Ἀριάδνη θυγάτηρ Μίνωος ἐρωτικῶς διατεθεῖσα πρὸς αὐτὸν συμπράσσειν ἐπαγγέλλεται,ἐὰν ὁμολογήσῃ γυναῖκα αὐτὴν ἕξειν ἀπαγαγὼν εἰς Ἀθήνας. ὁμολογήσαντος δὲ σὺν ὅρκοις Θησέως δεῖται Δαιδάλου μηνῦσαι τοῦ λαβυρίνθου τὴν ἔξοδον.

[8] And when he came to Crete, Ariadne, daughter of Minos, being amorously disposed to him, offered to help him if he would agree to carry her away to Athens and have her to wife. Theseus having agreed on oath to do so, she besought Daedalus to disclose the way out of the labyrinth.

[9] ὑποθεμένου δὲ ἐκείνου, λίνον εἰσιόντι Θησεῖ δίδωσι: τοῦτο ἐξάψας Θησεὺς τῆς θύρας ἐφελκόμενος εἰσῄει. καταλαβὼν δὲ Μινώταυρον ἐν ἐσχάτῳ μέρει τοῦ λαβυρίνθου παίων πυγμαῖς ἀπέκτεινεν, ἐφελκόμενος δὲ τὸ λίνον πάλιν ἐξῄει. καὶ διὰ νυκτὸς μετὰ Ἀριάδνης καὶ τῶν παίδων εἰς Νάξον ἀφικνεῖται. ἔνθα Διόνυσος ἐρασθεὶς Ἀριάδνης ἥρπασε, καὶ κομίσας εἰς Λῆμνον ἐμίγη.καὶ γεννᾷ Θόαντα Στάφυλον Οἰνοπίωνα καὶ Πεπάρηθον.

[9] And at his suggestion she gave Theseus a clue when he went in; Theseus fastened it to the door, and, drawing it after him, entered in. And having found the Minotaur in the last part of the labyrinth, he killed him by smiting him with his fists; and drawing the clue after him made his way out again. And by night he arrived with Ariadne and the children at Naxos. There Dionysus fell in love with Ariadne and carried her off; and having brought her to Lemnos he enjoyed her, and begat Thoas, Staphylus, Oenopion, and Peparethus.

[10] λυπούμενος δὲ Θησεὺς ἐπ᾽ Ἀριάδνῃ καταπλέων ἐπελάθετο πετάσαι τὴν ναῦν λευκοῖς ἱστίοις. Αἰγεὺς δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς ἀκροπόλεως τὴν ναῦν ἰδὼν ἔχουσαν μέλαν ἱστίον, Θησέα νομίσας ἀπολλέναι ῥίψας ἑαυτὸν μετήλλαξε.

[10] In his grief on account of Ariadne, Theseus forgot to spread white sails on his ship when he stood for port; and Aegeus, seeing from the acropolis the ship with a black sail, supposed that Theseus had perished; so he cast himself down and died.

[11] Θησεὺς δὲ παρέλαβε τὴν Ἀθηναίων δυναστείαν, καὶτοὺς μὲν Πάλλαντος παῖδας πεντήκοντα τὸν ἀριθμὸν ἀπέκτεινεν: ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ ὅσοι ἀντᾶραι ἤθελον παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἀπεκτάνθησαν, καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν ἅπασαν ἔσχε μόνος.

[11] But Theseus succeeded to the sovereignty of Athens, and killed the sons of Pallas, fifty in number; likewise all who would oppose him were killed by him, and he got the whole government to himself.

[12] ὅτι Μίνως, αἰσθόμενος τοῦ φεύγειν τοὺς μετὰ Θησέως, Δαίδαλον αἴτιον ἐν τῷ λαβυρίνθῳ μετὰ τοῦ παιδὸς Ἰκάρου καθεῖρξεν, ὃς ἐγεγέννητο αὐτῷ ἐκ δούλης Μίνωος Ναυκράτης. ὁ δὲ πτερὰ κατασκευάσας ἑαυτῷ καὶ τῷ παιδὶ ἀναπτάντι ἐνετείλατο μήτε εἰς ὕψος πέτεσθαι, μὴ τακείσης τῆς κόλλης ὑπὸ τοῦ ἡλίου αἱ πτέρυγες λυθῶσι, μήτε ἐγγὺς θαλάσσης, ἵνα μὴ τὰ πτερὰ ὑπὸ τῆς νοτίδος λυθῇ.

[12] On being apprized of the flight of Theseus and his company, Minos shut up the guilty Daedalus in the labyrinth, along with his son Icarus, who had been borne to Daedalus by Naucrate, a female slave of Minos. But Daedalus constructed wings for himself and his son, and enjoined his son, when he took to flight, neither to fly high, lest the glue should melt in the sun and the wings should drop off, nor to fly near the sea, lest the pinions should be detached by the damp.

[13] Ἴκαρος δὲ ἀμελήσας τῶν τοῦ πατρὸς ἐντολῶν ψυχαγωγούμενος ἀεὶ μετέωρος ἐφέρετο: τακείσης δὲ τῆς κόλλης πεσὼν εἰς τὴν ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνου κληθεῖσαν Ἰκαρίαν θάλασσαν ἀπέθανε. Δαίδαλος δὲ διασώζεται εἰς Κάμικον τῆς Σικελίας.

[13] But the infatuated Icarus, disregarding his father’s injunctions, soared ever higher, till, the glue melting, he fell into the sea called after him Icarian, and perished. But Daedalus made his way safely to Camicus in Sicily.

[14] Δαίδαλον δὲ ἐδίωκε Μίνως, καὶ καθ᾽ ἑκάστην χώραν ἐρευνῶν ἐκόμιζε κόχλον, καὶ πολὺν ἐπηγγέλλετο δώσειν μισθὸν τῷ διὰ τοῦ κοχλίου λίνον διείραντι, διὰ τούτου νομίζων εὑρήσειν Δαίδαλον. ἐλθὼν δὲ εἰς Κάμικον τῆς Σικελίας παρὰ Κώκαλον, παρ᾽ ᾧ Δαίδαλος ἐκρύπτετο, δείκνυσι τὸν κοχλίαν. ὁ δὲ λαβὼν ἐπηγγέλλετο διείρειν καὶ Δαιδάλῳ δίδωσιν:

[14] And Minos pursued Daedalus, and in every country that he searched he carried a spiral shell and promised to give a great reward to him who should pass a thread through the shell, believing that by that means he should discover Daedalus. And having come to Camicus in Sicily, to the court of Cocalus, with whom Daedalus was concealed, he showed the spiral shell. Cocalus took it, and promised to thread it, and gave it to Daedalus;

[15] ὁ δὲ ἐξάψας μύρμηκος λίνον καὶ τρήσας τὸν κοχλίαν εἴασε δι᾽ αὐτοῦ διελθεῖν. λαβὼν δὲ Μίνως τὸ λίνον διειρμένον ᾔσθετο ὄντα παρ᾽ ἐκείνῳ Δαίδαλον, καὶ εὐθέως ἀπῄτει. Κώκαλος δὲ ὑποσχόμενος ἐκδώσειν ἐξένισεν αὐτόν: ὁ δὲ λουσάμενος ὑπὸ τῶν Κωκάλου θυγατέρων ἔκλυτος ἐγένετο: ὡς δὲ ἔνιοί φασι, ζεστῷ καταχυθεὶς ὕδατι μετήλλαξεν.

[15] and Daedalus fastened a thread to an ant, and, having bored a hole in the spiral shell, allowed the ant to pass through it. But when Minos found the thread passed through the shell, he perceived that Daedalus was with Cocalus, and at once demanded his surrender. Cocalus promised to surrender him, and made an entertainment for Minos; but after his bath Minos was undone by the daughters of Cocalus; some say, however, that he died through being drenched with boiling water.

[16] συστρατευσάμενος δὲ ἐπὶ Ἀμαζόνας Ἡρακλεῖ ἥρπασενἈντιόπην, ὡς δέ τινες Μελανίππην, Σιμωνίδης δὲ Ἱππολύτην. διὸ ἐστράτευσαν ἐπ᾽ Ἀθήνας Ἀμαζόνες. καὶ στρατοπεδευσαμένας αὐτὰς περὶ τὸν Ἄρειον πάγον Θησεὺς μετὰ Ἀθηναίων ἐνίκησεν.ἔχων δὲ ἐκ τῆς Ἀμαζόνος παῖδα Ἱππόλυτον,

[16] Theseus joined Hercules in his expedition against the Amazons and carried off Antiope, or, as some say, Melanippe; but Simonides calls her Hippolyte. Wherefore the Amazons marched against Athens, and having taken up a position about the Areopagus they were vanquished by the Athenians under Theseus. And though he had a son Hippolytus by the Amazon,

[17] λαμβάνει μετὰ ταῦτα παρὰ Δευκαλίωνος Φαίδραν τὴν Μίνωος θυγατέρα,ἧς ἐπιτελουμένων τῶν γάμων Ἀμαζὼν ἡ προγαμηθεῖσα Θησεῖ τοὺς συγκατακειμένους σὺν ταῖς μεθ᾽ ἑαυτῆς Ἀμαζόσιν ἐπιστᾶσα σὺν ὅπλοις κτείνειν ἔμελλεν. οἱ δὲ κλείσαντες διὰ τάχους τὰς θύρας ἀπέκτειναν αὐτὴν. τινὲς δὲ μαχομένην αὐτὴν ὑπὸ Θησέως λέγουσιν ἀποθανεῖν.

[17] Theseus afterwards received from Deucalion in marriage Phaedra, daughter of Minos; and when her marriage was being celebrated, the Amazon that had before been married to him appeared in arms with her Amazons, and threatened to kill the assembled guests. But they hastily closed the doors and killed her. However, some say that she was slain in battle by Theseus.

[18] Φαίδρα δὲ γεννήσασα Θησεῖ δύο παιδία Ἀκάμαντα καὶ Δημοφῶντα ἐρᾷ τοῦ ἐκ τῆς Ἀμαζόνος παιδὸς ἤγουν τοῦ Ἱππολύτου καὶ δεῖται συνελθεῖν αὐτῇ. ὁ δὲ μισῶν πάσας γυναῖκας τὴν συνουσίαν ἔφυγεν. ἡ δὲ Φαίδρα, δείσασα μὴ τῷ πατρὶ διαβάλῃ, κατασχίσασα τὰς τοῦ θαλάμου θύρας καὶ τὰς ἐσθῆτας σπαράξασα κατεψεύσατο Ἱππολύτου βίαν.

[18] And Phaedra, after she had borne two children, Acamas and Demophon, to Theseus, fell in love with the son he had by the Amazon, to wit, Hippolytus, and besought him to lie with her. Howbeit, he fled from her embraces, because he hated all women. But Phaedra, fearing that he might accuse her to his father, cleft open the doors of her bed-chamber, rent her garments, and falsely charged Hippolytus with an assault.

[19] Θησεὺς δὲ πιστεύσας ηὔξατο Ποσειδῶνι Ἱππόλυτον διαφθαρῆναι: ὁ δέ, θέοντος αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τοῦ ἅρματος καὶ παρὰ τῇ θαλάσσῃ ὀχουμένου, ταῦρον ἀνῆκεν ἐκ τοῦ κλύδωνος. πτοηθέντων δὲ τῶν ἵππων κατηρράχθη τὸ ἅρμα. ἐμπλακεὶς δὲ ταῖς ἡνίαις Ἱππόλυτος συρόμενος ἀπέθανε. γενομένου δὲ τοῦ ἔρωτος περιφανοῦς ἑαυτὴν ἀνήρτησε Φαίδρα.

[19] Theseus believed her and prayed to Poseidon that Hippolytus might perish. So, when Hippolytus was riding in his chariot and driving beside the sea, Poseidon sent up a bull from the surf, and the horses were frightened, the chariot dashed in pieces, and Hippolytus, entangled in the reins, was dragged to death. And when her passion was made public, Phaedra hanged herself.

[20] ὅτι ὁ Ἰξίων Ἥρας ἐρασθεὶς ἐπεχείρει βιάζεσθαι, καὶ προσαγγειλάσης τῆς Ἥρας γνῶναι θέλων ὁ Ζεύς, εἰ οὕτως ἔχει τὸ πρᾶγμα, νεφέλην ἐξεικάσας Ἥρᾳ παρέκλινεν αὐτῷ: καὶ καυχώμενον ὡς Ἥρᾳ μιγέντα ἐνέδησε τροχῷ, ὑφ᾽ οὗ φερόμενος διὰ πνευμάτων ἐν αἰθέρι ταύτην τίνει δίκην. νεφέλη δὲ ἐξ Ἰξίονος ἐγέννησε Κένταυρον.

[20] Ixion fell in love with Hera and attempted to force her; and when Hera reported it, Zeus, wishing to know if the thing were so, made a cloud in the likeness of Hera and laid it beside him; and when Ixion boasted that he had enjoyed the favours of Hera, Zeus bound him to a wheel, on which he is whirled by winds through the air; such is the penalty he pays. And the cloud, impregnated by Ixion, gave birth to Centaurus.

[21] συνεμάχησε δὲ τῷ Πειρίθῳ Θησεύς, ὅτε κατὰ τῶν Κενταύρων συνεστήσατο πόλεμον. Πειρίθους γὰρ Ἱπποδάμειαν μνηστευόμενος εἱστία Κενταύρους ὡς συγγενεῖς ὄντας αὐτῇ. ἀσυνήθως δὲ ἔχοντες οἴνου ἀφειδῶς ἐμφορησάμενοι ἐμέθυον, καὶ εἰσαγομένην τὴν νύμφην ἐπεχείρουν βιάζεσθαι: ὁ δὲ Πειρίθους μετὰ Θησέως καθοπλισάμενος μάχην συνῆψε, καὶ πολλοὺς ὁ Θησεὺς αὐτῶν ἀνεῖλεν.

[21] “ And Theseus allied himself with Pirithous, when he engaged in war against the centaurs. For when Pirithous wooed Hippodamia, he feasted the centaurs because they were her kinsmen. But being unaccustomed to wine, they made themselves drunk by swilling it greedily, and when the bride was brought in, they attempted to violate her. But Pirithous, fully armed, with Theseus, joined battle with them, and Theseus killed many of them.”Zenobius, Cent. v.33.

[22] ὅτι Καινεὺς πρότερον ἦν γυνή, συνελθόντος δὲ αὐτῇ Ποσειδῶνος ᾐτήσατο ἀνὴρ γενέσθαι ἄτρωτος: διὸ καὶ ἐν τῇ πρὸς Κενταύρους μάχῃ τραυμάτων καταφρονῶν πολλοὺς τῶν Κενταύρων ἀπώλεσεν, οἱ δὲ λοιποί, περιστάντες αὐτῷ, ἐλάταις τύπτοντες ἔχωσαν εἰς γῆν.

[22] Caeneus was formerly a woman, but after that Poseidon had intercourse with her, she asked to become an invulnerable man; wherefore in the battle with the centaurs he thought scorn of wounds and killed many of the centaurs; but the rest of them surrounded him and by striking him with fir trees buried him in the earth.

[23] ὅτι Θησεύς, Πειρίθῳ συνθέμενος Διὸς θυγατέρας γαμῆσαι, ἑαυτῷ μὲν ἐκ Σπάρτης μετ᾽ ἐκείνου ἥρπασεν Ἑλένην δωδεκαέτη οὖσαν, Πειρίθῳ δὲ μνηστευόμενος τὸν Περσεφόνης γάμον εἰς Ἅιδου κάτεισι. καὶ Διόσκουροι μὲν μετὰ Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ Ἀρκάδων εἷλον Ἀθήνας καὶ ἀπάγουσιν Ἑλένην καὶ μετὰ ταύτης Αἴθραν τὴν Πιτθέως αἰχμάλωτον: Δημοφῶν δὲ καὶ Ἀκάμας ἔφυγον. κατάγουσι δὲ καὶ Μενεσθέα καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν τῶν Ἀθηναίων διδόασι τούτῳ.

[23] Having made a compact with Pirithous that they would marry daughters of Zeus, Theseus, with the help of Pirithous, carried off Helen from Sparta for himself, when she was twelve years old, and in the endeavor to win Persephone as a bride for Pirithous he went down to Hades. And the Dioscuri, with the Lacedaemonians and Arcadians, captured Athens and carried away Helen, and with her Aethra, daughter of Pittheus, into captivity; but Demophon and Acamas fled. And the Dioscuri also brought back Menestheus from exile, and gave him the sovereignty of Athens.

[24] Θησεὺς δὲ μετὰ Πειρίθου παραγενόμενος εἰς Ἅιδου ἐξαπατᾶται, καὶ ὃς ὡς ξενίων μεταληψομένους πρῶτον ἐν τῷ τῆς Λήθης εἶπε καθεσθῆναι θρόνῳ, ᾧ προσφυέντες σπείραις δρακόντων κατείχοντο. Πειρίθους μὲν οὖν εἰς ἀίδιον δεθεὶς ἔμεινε, Θησέα δὲ Ἡρακλῆς ἀναγαγὼν ἔπεμψεν εἰς Ἀθήνας. ἐκεῖθεν δὲ ὑπὸ Μενεσθέως ἐξελαθεὶς πρὸς Λυκομήδην ἦλθεν, ὃς αὐτὸν βάλλει κατὰ βαράθρων καὶ ἀποκτείνει.

[24] But when Theseus arrived with Pirithous in Hades, he was beguiled; for, on the pretence that they were about to partake of good cheer, Hades bade them first be seated on the Chair of Forgetfulness, to which they grew and were held fast by coils of serpents. Pirithous, therefore, remained bound for ever, but Hercules brought Theseus up and sent him to Athens. Thence he was driven by Menestheus and went to Lycomedes, who threw him down an abyss and killed him.

[1] ὅτι ὁ Τάνταλος ἐν Ἅιδου κολάζεται, πέτρον ἔχων ὕπερθεν ἑαυτοῦ ἐπιφερόμενον, ἐν λίμνῃ τε διατελῶν καὶ περὶ τοὺς ὤμους ἑκατέρωσε δένδρα μετὰ καρπῶν ὁρῶν παρὰ τῇ λίμνῃ πεφυκότα: τὸ μὲν οὖν ὕδωρ ψαύει αὐτοῦ τῶν γενύων, καὶ ὅτε θέλοι σπάσασθαι τούτου ξηραίνεται, τῶν δὲ καρπῶν ὁπότε βούλοιτο μεταλήψεσθαι μετεωρίζονται μέχρι νεφῶν ὑπ᾽ ἀνέμων τὰ δένδρα σὺν τοῖς καρποῖς. κολάζεσθαι δὲ αὐτὸν οὕτως λέγουσί τινες, ὅτι τὰ τῶν θεῶν ἐξελάλησεν ἀνθρώποις μυστήρια, καὶ ὅτι τῆς ἀμβροσίας τοῖς ἡλικιώταις μετεδίδου.

[1] Tantalus is punished in Hades by having a stone impending over him, by being perpetually in a lake and seeing at his shoulders on either side trees with fruit growing beside the lake. The water touches his jaws, but when he would take a draught of it, the water dries up; and when he would partake of the fruits, the trees with the fruits are lifted by winds as high as the clouds. Some say that he is thus punished because he blabbed to men the mysteries of the gods, and because he attempted to share ambrosia with his fellows.

[2] ὅτι Βροτέας κυνηγὸς ὢν τὴν Ἄρτεμιν οὐκ ἐτίμα: ἔλεγε δέ, ὡς οὐδ᾽ ἂν ὑπὸ πυρός τι πάθοι: ἐμμανὴς οὖν γενόμενος ἔβαλεν εἰς πῦρ ἑαυτόν.

[2] Broteas, a hunter, did not honor Artemis, and said that even fire could not hurt him. So he went mad and threw himself into fire.

[3] ὅτι Πέλοψ σφαγεὶς ἐν τῷ τῶν θεῶν ἐράνῳ καὶ καθεψηθεὶς ὡραιότερος ἐν τῇ ἀναζωώσει γέγονε, καὶ κάλλει διενεγκὼν Ποσειδῶνος ἐρώμενος γίνεται, ὃς αὐτῷ δίδωσιν ἅρμα ὑπόπτερον: τοῦτο καὶ διὰ θαλάσσης τρέχον τοὺς ἄξονας οὐχ ὑγραίνετο.

[3] Pelops, after being slaughtered and boiled at the banquet of the gods, was fairer than ever when he came to life again, and on account of his surpassing beauty he became a minion of Poseidon, who gave him a winged chariot, such that even when it ran through the sea the axles were not wet.

[4] τοῦ δὲ βασιλεύοντος Πίσης Οἰνομάου θυγατέρα ἔχοντος Ἱπποδάμειαν, καὶ εἴτε αὐτῆς ἐρῶντος, ὥς τινες λέγουσιν, εἴτε χρησμὸν ἔχοντος τελευτῆσαι ὑπὸ τοῦ γήμαντος αὐτήν, οὐδεὶς αὐτὴν ἐλάμβανεν εἰς γυναῖκα: ὁ μὲν γὰρ πατὴρ οὐκ ἔπειθεν αὑτῷ συνελθεῖν, οἱ δὲ μνηστευόμενοι ἀνῃροῦντο ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ.

[4] Now Oenomaus, the king of Pisa, had a daughter Hippodamia, and whether it was that he loved her, as some say, or that he was warned by an oracle that he must die by the man that married her, no man got her to wife; for her father could not persuade her to cohabit with him, and her suitors were put by him to death.

[5] ἔχων γὰρ ὅπλα τε καὶ ἵππους παρὰ Ἄρεος ἆθλον ἐτίθει τοῖς μνηστῆρσι τὸν γάμον, καὶ τὸν μνηστευόμενον ἔδει ἀναλαβόντα τὴν Ἱπποδάμειαν εἰς τὸ οἰκεῖον ἅρμα φεύγειν ἄχρι τοῦ Κορινθίων ἰσθμοῦ, τὸν δὲ Οἰνόμαον εὐθέως διώκειν καθωπλισμένον καὶ καταλαβόντα κτείνειν: τὸν δὲ μὴ καταληφθέντα ἔχειν γυναῖκα τὴν Ἱπποδάμειαν. καὶ τοῦτον τὸν τρόπον πολλοὺς μνηστευομένους ἀπέκτεινεν, ὡς δέ τινες λέγουσι δώδεκα: τὰς δὲ κεφαλὰς τῶν μνηστήρων ἐκτεμὼν τῇ οἰκίᾳ προσεπαττάλευε.

[5] For he had arms and horses given him by Ares, and he offered as a prize to the suitors the hand of his daughter, and each suitor was bound to take up Hippodamia on his own chariot and flee as far as the Isthmus of Corinth, and Oenomaus straightway pursued him, in full armour, and if he overtook him he slew him; but if the suitor were not overtaken, he was to have Hippodamia to wife. And in this way he slew many suitors, some say twelve; and he cut off the heads of the suitors and nailed them to his house.

[6] παραγίνεται τοίνυν καὶ Πέλοψ ἐπὶ τὴν μνηστείαν: οὗ τὸ κάλλος ἰδοῦσα ἡ Ἱπποδάμεια ἔρωτα ἔσχεν αὐτοῦ, καὶ πείθει Μυρτίλον τὸν Ἑρμοῦ παῖδα συλλαβέσθαι αὐτῷ: ἦν δὲ Μυρτίλος παρας βάτης εἴτουν ἡνίοχος Οἰνομάου.

[6] So Pelops also came a-wooing; and when Hippodamia saw his beauty, she conceived a passion for him, and persuaded Myrtilus, son of Hermes, to help him; for Myrtilus was charioteer to Oenomaus.

[7] Μυρτίλος οὖν ἐρῶν αὐτῆς καὶ βουλόμενος αὐτῇ χαρίσασθαι, ταῖς χοινικίσι τῶν τροχῶν τοὺς ἥλους οὐκ ἐμβαλὼν ἐποίησε τὸν Οἰνόμαον ἐν τῷ τρέχειν ἡττηθῆναι καὶ ταῖς ἡνίαις συμπλακέντα συρόμενον ἀποθανεῖν, κατὰ δέ τινας ἀναιρεθῆναι ὑπὸ τοῦ Πέλοπος: ὃ ἐν τῷ ἀποθνήσκειν κατηράσατο τῷ Μυρτίλῳ γνοὺς τὴν ἐπιβουλήν, ἵνα ὑπὸ Πέλοπος ἀπόληται.

[7] Accordingly Myrtilus, being in love with her and wishing to gratify her, did not insert the linchpins in the boxes of the wheels, and thus caused Oenomaus to lose the race and to be entangled in the reins and dragged to death; but according to some, he was killed by Pelops. And in dying he cursed Myrtilus, whose treachery he had discovered, praying that he might perish by the hand of Pelops.

[8] λαβὼν οὖν Πέλοψ τὴν Ἱπποδάμειαν καὶ διερχόμενος ἐν τόπῳ τινί, τὸν Μυρτίλον ἔχων μεθ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ, μικρὸν ἀναχωρεῖ κομίσων ὕδωρ διψώσῃ τῇ γυναικί: Μυρτίλος δὲ ἐν τούτῳ βιάζειν αὐτὴν ἐπεχείρει. μαθὼν δὲ τοῦτο παρ᾽ αὐτῆς ὁ Πέλοψ ῥίπτει τὸν Μυρτίλον περὶ Γεραιστὸν ἀκρωτήριον εἰς τὸ ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνου κληθὲν Μυρτῷον πέλαγος: ὁ δὲ ῥιπτούμενος ἀρὰς ἔθετο κατὰ τοῦ Πέλοπος γένους.

[8] Pelops, therefore, got Hippodamia; and on his journey, in which he was accompanied by Myrtilus, he came to a certain place, and withdrew a little to fetch water for his wife, who was athirst; and in the meantime Myrtilus tried to rape her. But when Pelops learned that from her, he threw Myrtilus into the sea, called after him the Myrtoan Sea, at Cape Geraestus; and Myrtilus, as he was being thrown, uttered curses against the house of Pelops.

[9] παραγενόμενος δὲ Πέλοψ ἐπ᾽ ὠκεανὸν καὶ ἁγνισθεὶς ὑπὸ Ἡφαίστου, ἐπανελθὼν εἰς Πῖσαν τῆς Ἤλιδος τὴν Οἰνομάου βασιλείαν λαμβάνει, χειρωσάμενος τὴν πρότερον Ἀπίαν καὶ Πελασγιῶτιν λεγομένην, ἣν ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ Πελοπόννησον ἐκάλεσεν.

[9] When Pelops had reached the Ocean and been cleansed by Hephaestus, he returned to Pisa in Elis and succeeded to the kingdom of Oenomaus, but not till he had subjugated what was formerly called Apia and Pelasgiotis, which he called Peloponnesus after himself.

[10] ὅτι υἱοὶ Πέλοπος Πιτθεὺς Ἀτρεὺς Θυέστης καὶ ἕτεροι: γυνὴ δὲ Ἀτρέως Ἀερόπη τοῦ Κατρέως, ἥτις ἤρα Θυέστου. ὁ δὲ Ἀτρεὺς εὐξάμενός ποτε τῶν αὑτοῦ ποιμνίων, ὅπερ ἂν κάλλιστον γένηται, τοῦτο θῦσαι Ἀρτέμιδι, λέγουσιν ἀρνὸς φανείσης χρυσῆς ὅτι κατημέλησε τῆς εὐχῆς:

[10] The sons of Pelops were Pittheus, Atreus, Thyestes, and others. Now the wife of Atreus was Aerope, daughter of Catreus, and she loved Thyestes. And Atreus once vowed to sacrifice to Artemis the finest of his flocks; but when a golden lamb appeared, they say that he neglected to perform his vow,

[11] πνίξας δὲ αὐτὴν εἰς λάρνακα κατέθετο κἀκεῖ ἐφύλασσε ταύτην: ἣν Ἀερόπη δίδωσι τῷ Θυέστῃ μοιχευθεῖσα ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ. χρησμοῦ γὰρ γεγονότος τοῖς Μυκηναίοις ἑλέσθαι βασιλέα Πελοπίδην, μετεπέμψαντο Ἀτρέα καὶ Θυέστην. λόγου δὲ γενομένου περὶ τῆς βασιλείας ἐξεῖπε Θυέστης τῷ πλήθει τὴν βασιλείαν δεῖν ἔχειν τὸν ἔχοντα τὴν ἄρνα τὴν χρυσῆν: συνθεμένου δὲ τοῦ Ἀτρέως δείξας ἐβασίλευσε.

[11] and having choked the lamb, he deposited it in a box and kept it there, and Aerope gave it to Thyestes, by whom she had been debauched. For the Mycenaeans had received an oracle which bade them choose a Pelopid for their king, and they had sent for Atreus and Thyestes. And when a discussion took place concerning the kingdom, Thyestes declared to the multitude that the kingdom ought to belong to him who owned the golden lamb, and when Atreus agreed, Thyestes produced the lamb and was made king.

[12] Ζεὺς δὲ Ἑρμῆν πέμπει πρὸς Ἀτρέα καὶ λέγει συνθέσθαι πρὸς Θυέστην περὶ τοῦ βασιλεῦσαι Ἀτρέα, εἰ τὴν ἐναντίαν ὁδεύσει ὁ Ἥλιος: Θυέστου δὲ συνθεμένου τὴν δύσιν εἰς ἀνατολὰς ὁ Ἥλιος ἐποιήσατο: ὅθεν ἐκμαρτυρήσαντος τοῦ δαίμονος τὴν Θυέστου πλεονεξίαν, τὴν βασιλείαν Ἀτρεὺς παρέλαβε καὶ Θυέστην ἐφυγάδευσεν.

[12] But Zeus sent Hermes to Atreus and told him to stipulate with Thyestes that Atreus should be king if the sun should go backward; and when Thyestes agreed, the sun set in the east; hence the deity having plainly attested the usurpation of Thyestes, Atreus got the kingdom and banished Thyestes.

[13] αἰσθόμενος δὲ τῆς μοιχείας ὕστερον κήρυκα πέμψας ἐπὶ διαλλαγὰς αὐτὸν ἐκάλει: καὶ ψευσάμενος εἶναι φίλος, παραγενομένου τοὺς παῖδας, οὓς εἶχεν ἐκ νηίδος νύμφης, Ἀγλαὸν καὶ Καλλιλέοντα καὶ Ὀρχομενόν, ἐπὶ τὸν Διὸς βωμὸν καθεσθέντας ἱκέτας ἔσφαξε, καὶ μελίσας καὶ καθεψήσας παρατίθησι Θυέστῃ χωρὶς τῶν ἄκρων, ἐμφορηθέντι δὲ δείκνυσι τὰ ἄκρα καὶ τῆς χώρας αὐτὸν ἐκβάλλει.

[13] But afterwards being apprized of the adultery, he sent a herald to Thyestes with a proposal of accommodation; and when he had lured Thyestes by a pretence of friendship, he slaughtered the sons, Aglaus, Callileon, and Orchomenus, whom Thyestes had by a Naiad nymph, though they had sat down as suppliants on the altar of Zeus. And having cut them limb from limb and boiled them, he served them up to Thyestes without the extremities; and when Thyestes had eaten heartily of them, he showed him the extremities, and cast him out of the country.

[14] Θυέστης δὲ κατὰ πάντα τρόπον ζητῶν Ἀτρέα μετελθεῖν ἐχρηστηριάζετο περὶ τούτου καὶ λαμβάνει χρησμόν, ὡς εἰ παῖδα γεννήσει τῇ θυγατρὶ συνελθών. ποιεῖ οὖν οὕτω καὶ γεννᾷ ἐκ τῆς θυγατρὸς Αἴγισθον, ὃς ἀνδρωθεὶς καὶ μαθών, ὅτι Θυέστου παῖς ἐστι, κτείνας Ἀτρέα Θυέστῃ τὴν βασιλείαν ἀποκατέστησεν.

[14] But seeking by all means to pay Atreus out, Thyestes inquired of the oracle on the subject, and received an answer that it could be done if he were to beget a son by intercourse with his own daughter. He did so accordingly, and begot Aegisthus by his daughter. And Aegisthus, when he was grown to manhood and had learned that he was a son of Thyestes, killed Atreus, and restored the kingdom to Thyestes.

[15]  “τὸν δ᾽ Ἀγαμέμνονα τροφὸς μετὰ τοῦ Μενελάου ἄγει πρὸς Πολυφείδεα, κρατοῦντα Σικυῶνος, ὃς πάλιν τούτους πέπομφε πρὸς Αἰτωλὸν Οἰνέα. μετ᾽ οὐ πολὺ Τυνδάρεως τούτους κατάγει πάλιν, οἳ τὸν Θυέστην μὲν αὐτὸν Ἥρας βωμῷ φυγόντα ὁρκώσαντες διώκουσιν οἰκεῖν τὴν Κυθηρίαν. οἱ δὲ Τυνδάρεω γαμβροὶ γίνονται θυγατράσιν, ὁ Ἀγαμέμνων μὲν λαβὼν σύνευνον Κλυταιμνήστραν, κτείνας αὐτῆς τὸν σύζυγον Τάνταλον τὸν Θυέστου σὺν τέκνῳ πάνυ νεογνῷ, Μενέλαος Ἑλένην. “ Tzetzes, Chiliades,1. 456-465

[15] “ But the nurse took Agamemnon and Menelaus
to Polyphides, lord of Sicyon,
who again sent them to Oeneus, the Aetolian.
Not long afterwards Tyndareus brought them back again,
and they drove away Thyestes to dwell in Cytheria,
after that they had taken an oath of him at the altar of Hera, to which he had fled.
And they became the sons-in-law of Tyndareus by marrying his daughters,
Agamemnon getting Clytaemnestra to wife,
after he had slain her spouse Tantalus, the son of Thyestes,
together with his newborn babe, while Menelaus got Helen.
“

[16] Ἀγαμέμνων δὲ βασιλεύει Μυκηναίων καὶ γαμεῖ Τυνδάρεω θυγατέρα Κλυταιμνήστραν, τὸν πρότερον αὐτῆς ἄνδρα Τάνταλον Θυέστου σὺν τῷ παιδὶ κτείνας, καὶ γίνεται αὐτῷ παῖς μὲν Ὀρέστης, θυγατέρες δὲ Χρυσόθεμις Ἠλέκτρα Ἰφιγένεια. Μενέλαος δὲ Ἑλένην γαμεῖ καὶ βασιλεύει Σπάρτης, Τυνδάρεω τὴν βασιλείαν δόντος αὐτῷ.

[16] And Agamemnon reigned over the Mycenaeans and married Clytaemnestra, daughter of Tyndareus, after slaying her former husband Tantalus, son of Thyestes, with his child. And there were born to Agamemnon a son Orestes, and daughters, Chrysothemis, Electra, and Iphigenia. And Menelaus married Helen and reigned over Sparta, Tyndareus having ceded the kingdom to him.

[1] αὖθις δὲ Ἑλένην Ἀλέξανδρος ἁρπάζει, ὥς τινες λέγουσι κατὰ βούλησιν Διός, ἵνα Εὐρώπης καὶ Ἀσίας εἰς πόλεμον ἐλθούσης ἡ θυγάτηρ αὐτοῦ ἔνδοξος γένηται, ἢ καθάπερ εἶπον ἄλλοι ὅπως τὸ τῶν ἡμιθέων γένος ἀρθῇ.

[1] But afterwards Alexander carried off Helen, as some say, because such was the will of Zeus, in order that his daughter might be famous for having embroiled Europe and Asia; or, as others have said, that the race of the demigods might be exalted.

[2] διὰ δὴ τούτων μίαν αἰτίαν μῆλον περὶ κάλλους Ἔρις ἐμβάλλει Ἥρᾳ καὶ Ἀθηνᾷ καὶ Ἀφροδίτῃ, καὶ κελεύει Ζεὺς Ἑρμῆν εἰς Ἴδην πρὸς Ἀλέξανδρον ἄγειν, ἵνα ὑπ᾽ ἐκείνου διακριθῶσι. αἱ δὲ ἐπαγγέλλονται δῶρα δώσειν Ἀλεξάνδρῳ, Ἥρα μὲν πασῶν προκριθεῖσα βασιλείαν πάντων, Ἀθηνᾶ δὲ πολέμου νίκην, Ἀφροδίτη δὲ γάμον Ἑλένης. ὁ δὲ Ἀφροδίτην προκρίνει καὶ πηξαμένου Φερέκλου ναῦς εἰς Σπάρτην ἐκπλέει.

[2] For one of these reasons Strife threw an apple as a prize of beauty to be contended for by Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite; and Zeus commanded Hermes to lead them to Alexander on Ida in order to be judged by him. And they promised to give Alexander gifts. Hera said that if she were preferred to all women, she would give him the kingdom over all men; and Athena promised victory in war, and Aphrodite the hand of Helen. And he decided in favour of Aphrodite; and sailed away to Sparta with ships built by Phereclus.

[3] ἐφ᾽ ἡμέρας δ᾽ ἐννέα ξενισθεὶς παρὰ Μενελάῳ, τῇ δεκάτῃ πορευθέντος εἰς Κρήτην ἐκείνου κηδεῦσαι τὸν μητροπάτορα Κατρέα, πείθει τὴν Ἑλένην ἀπαγαγεῖν σὺν ἑαυτῷ. ἡ δὲ ἐνναέτη Ἑρμιόνην καταλιποῦσα, ἐνθεμένη τὰ πλεῖστα τῶν χρημάτων, ἀνάγεται τῆς νυκτὸς σὺν αὐτῷ.

[3] For nine days he was entertained by Menelaus; but on the tenth day, Menelaus having gone on a journey to Crete to perform the obsequies of his mother’s father Catreus, Alexander persuaded Helen to go off with him. And she abandoned Hermione, then nine years old, and putting most of the property on board, she set sail with him by night.

[4] Ἥρα δὲ αὐτοῖς ἐπιπέμπει χειμῶνα πολύν, ὑφ᾽ οὗ βιασθέντες προσίσχουσι Σιδῶνι. εὐλαβούμενος δὲ Ἀλέξανδρος μὴ διωχθῇ, πολὺν διέτριψε χρόνον ἐν Φοινίκῃ καὶ Κύπρῳ. ὡς δὲ ἀπήλπισε τὴν δίωξιν, ἧκεν εἰς Τροίαν μετὰ Ἑλένης.

[4] But Hera sent them a heavy storm which forced them to put in at Sidon. And fearing lest he should be pursued, Alexander spent much time in Phoenicia and Cyprus. But when he thought that all chance of pursuit was over, he came to Troy with Helen.

[5] ἔνιοι δέ φασιν Ἑλένην μὲν ὑπὸ Ἑρμοῦ κατὰ βούλησιν Διὸς κομισθῆναι κλαπεῖσαν εἰς Αἴγυπτον καὶ δοθεῖσαν Πρωτεῖ τῷ βασιλεῖ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων φυλάττειν, Ἀλέξανδρον δὲ παραγενέσθαι εἰς Τροίαν πεποιημένον ἐκ νεφῶν εἴδωλον Ἑλένης ἔχοντα.

[5] But some say that Hermes, in obedience to the will of Zeus, stole Helen and carried her to Egypt, and gave her to Proteus, king of the Egyptians, to guard, and that Alexander repaired to Troy with a phantom of Helen fashioned out of clouds.

[6] Μενέλαος δὲ αἰσθόμενος τὴν ἁρπαγὴν ἧκεν εἰς Μυκήνας πρὸς Ἀγαμέμνονα, καὶ δεῖται στρατείαν ἐπὶ Τροίαν ἀθροίζειν καὶ στρατολογεῖν τὴν Ἑλλάδα. ὁ δὲ πέμπων κήρυκα πρὸς ἕκαστον τῶν βασιλέων τῶν ὅρκων ὑπεμίμνησκεν ὧν ὤμοσαν, καὶ περὶ τῆς ἰδίας γυναικὸς ἕκαστον ἀσφαλίζεσθαι παρῄνει, ἴσην λέγων γεγενῆσθαι τὴν τῆς Ἑλλάδος καταφρόνησιν καὶ κοινήν. ὄντων δὲ πολλῶν προθύμων στρατεύεσθαι, παραγίνονται καὶ πρὸς Ὀδυσσέα εἰς Ἰθάκην.

[6] When Menelaus was aware of the rape, he came to Agamemnon at Mycenae, and begged him to muster an army against Troy and to raise levies in Greece. And he, sending a herald to each of the kings, reminded them of the oaths which they had sworn, and warned them to look to the safety each of his own wife, saying that the affront had been offered equally to the whole of Greece. And while many were eager to join in the expedition, some repaired also to Ulysses in Ithaca.

[7] ὁ δὲ οὐ βουλόμενος στρατεύεσθαι προσποιεῖται μανίαν. Παλαμήδης δὲ ὁ Ναυπλίου ἤλεγξε τὴν μανίαν ψευδῆ, καὶ προσποιησαμένῳ μεμηνέναι παρηκολούθει: ἁρπάσας δὲ Τηλέμαχον ἐκ τοῦ κόλπου τῆς Πηνελόπης ὡς κτενῶν ἐξιφούλκει. Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ περὶ τοῦ παιδὸς εὐλαβηθεὶς ὡμολόγησε τὴν προσποίητον μανίαν καὶ στρατεύεται.

[7] But he, not wishing to go to the war, feigned madness. However, Palamedes, son of Nauplius, proved his madness to be fictitious; and when Ulysses pretended to rave, Palamedes followed him, and snatching Telemachus from Penelope’s bosom, drew his sword as if he would kill him. And in his fear for the child Ulysses confessed that his madness was pretended, and he went to the war.

[8] ὅτι Ὀδυσσεὺς λαβὼν αἰχμάλωτον Φρύγα ἠνάγκασε γράψαι περὶ προδοσίας ὡς παρὰ Πριάμου πρὸς Παλαμήδην: καὶ χώσας ἐν ταῖς σκηναῖς αὐτοῦ χρυσὸν τὴν δέλτον ἔρριψεν ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ. Ἀγαμέμνων δὲ ἀναγνοὺς καὶ εὑρὼν τὸν χρυσόν, τοῖς συμμάχοις αὐτὸν ὡς προδότην παρέδωκε καταλεῦσαι.

[8] Having taken a Phrygian prisoner, Ulysses compelled him to write a letter of treasonable purport ostensibly sent by Priam to Palamedes; and having buried gold in the quarters of Palamedes, he dropped the letter in the camp. Agamemnon read the letter, found the gold, and delivered up Palamedes to the allies to be stoned as a traitor.

[9] ὅτι Μενέλαος σὺν Ὀδυσσεῖ καὶ Ταλθυβίῳ πρὸς Κινύραν εἰς Κύπρον ἐλθόντες συμμαχεῖν ἔπειθον: ὁ δὲ Ἀγαμέμνονι μὲν οὐ παρόντι θώρακας ἐδωρήσατο, ὀμόσας δὲ πέμψειν πεντήκοντα ναῦς, μίαν πέμψας, ἧς ἦρχεν ... ὁ Μυγδαλίωνος, καὶ τὰς λοιπὰς ἐκ γῆς πλάσας μεθῆκεν εἰς τὸ πέλαγος.

[9] Menelaus went with Ulysses and Talthybius to Cinyras in Cyprus and tried to persuade him to join the allies. He made a present of breastplates to the absent Agamemnon, and swore he would send fifty ships, but he sent only one, commanded by the son of Mygdalion, and the rest he moulded out of earth and launched them in the sea.

[10] ὅτι θυγατέρες Ἀνίου τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος Ἐλαῒς Σπερμὼ Οἰνώ, αἱ Οἰνότροφοι λεγόμεναι: αἷς ἐχαρίσατο Διόνυσος ποιεῖν ἐκ γῆς ἔλαιον σῖτον οἶνον.

[10] The daughters of Anius, the son of Apollo, to wit, Elais, Spermo, and Oeno, are called the Wine-growers: Dionysus granted them the power of producing oil, corn, and wine from the earth.

[11] The armament mustered in Aulis. The men who went to the Trojan war were as follows: — Of the Boeotians, ten leaders: they brought forty ships. Of the Orchomenians, four: they brought thirty ships. Of the Phocians, four leaders: they brought forty ships. Of the Locrians, Ajax, son of Oeleus: he brought forty ships. Of the Euboeans, Elephenor, son of Chalcodon and Alcyone: he brought forty ships. Of the Athenians, Menestheus: he brought fifty ships. Of the Salaminians, Telamonian Ajax: he brought twelve ships.

[12] Of the Argives, Diomedes, son of Tydeus, and his company: they brought eighty ships. Of the Mycenaeans, Agamemnon, son of Atreus and Aerope: a hundred ships. Of the Lacedaemonians, Menelaus, son of Atreus and Aerope: sixty ships. Of the Pylians, Nestor, son of Neleus and Chloris: forty ships. Of the Arcadians, Agapenor: seven ships.

[14] Of the Myrmidons, Achilles, son of Peleus and Thetis: fifty ships. From Phylace, Protesilaus, son of Iphiclus: forty ships. Of the Pheraeans, Eumelus, son of Admetus: eleven ships. Of the Olizonians, Philoctetes, son of Poeas: seven ships. Of the Aeanianians, Guneus, son of Ocytus: twenty-two ships. Of the Triccaeans, Podalirius:thirty ships. Of the Ormenians, Eurypylus: forty ships. Of the Gyrtonians, Polypoetes, son of Pirithous: thirty ships. Of the Magnesians, Prothous, son of Tenthredon: forty ships. The total of ships was one thousand and thirteen; of leaders, forty-three; of leaderships, thirty.

[15] ὅτι ὄντος ἐν Αὐλίδι τοῦ στρατεύματος, θυσίας γενομένης Ἀπόλλωνι, ὁρμήσας δράκων ἐκ τοῦ βωμοῦ παρὰ τὴν πλησίον πλάτανον, οὔσης ἐν αὐτῇ νεοττιᾶς, τοὺς ἐν αὐτῇ καταναλώσας στρουθοὺς ὀκτὼ σὺν τῇ μητρὶ ἐνάτῃ λίθος ἐγένετο. Κάλχας δὲ εἰπὼν κατὰ Διὸς βούλησιν γεγονέναι αὐτοῖς τὸ σημεῖον τοῦτο, τεκμηράμενος ἐκ τῶν γεγονότων ἔφη δεκαετεῖ χρόνῳ δεῖν Τροίαν ἁλῶναι.

[15] When the armament was in Aulis, after a sacrifice to Apollo, a serpent darted from the altar beside the neighboring plane-tree, in which there was a nest; and having consumed the eight sparrows in the nest, together with the mother bird, which made the ninth, it was turned to stone. Calchas said that this sign was given them by the will of Zeus, and he inferred from what had happened that Troy was destined to be taken in a period of ten years. And they made ready to sail against Troy.

[16] καὶ πλεῖν παρεσκευάζοντο ἐπὶ Τροίαν. Ἀγαμέμνων οὖν αὐτὸς ἡγεμὼν τοῦ σύμπαντος στρατοῦ ἦν, ἐναυάρχει δ᾽ Ἀχιλλεὺς πεντεκαιδεκαέτης τυγχάνων.

[16] So Agamemnon in person was in command of the whole army, and Achilles was admiral, being fifteen years old.

[17] ἀγνοοῦντες δὲ τὸν ἐπὶ Τροίαν πλοῦν Μυσίᾳ προσίσχουσι καὶ ταύτην ἐπόρθουν, Τροίαν νομίζοντες εἶναι. βασιλεύων δὲ Τήλεφος Μυσῶν, Ἡρακλέους παῖς, ἰδὼν τὴν χώραν λεηλατουμένην, τοὺς Μυσοὺς καθοπλίσας ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς συνεδίωκε τοὺς Ἕλληνας καὶ πολλοὺς ἀπέκτεινεν, ἐν οἷς καὶ Θέρσανδρον τὸν Πολυνείκους ὑποστάντα. ὁρμήσαντος δὲ Ἀχιλλέως ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν οὐ μείνας ἐδιώκετο: καὶ διωκόμενος ἐμπλακεὶς εἰς ἀμπέλου κλῆμα τὸν μηρὸν τιτρώσκεται δόρατι.

[17] But not knowing the course to steer for Troy, they put in to Mysia and ravaged it, supposing it to be Troy. Now Telephus son of Hercules, was king of the Mysians, and seeing the country pillaged, he armed the Mysians, chased the Greeks in a crowd to the ships, and killed many, among them Thersander, son of Polynices, who had made a stand. But when Achilles rushed at him, Telephus did not abide the onset and was pursued, and in the pursuit he was entangled in a vine-branch and wounded with a spear in the thigh.

[18] τῆς δὲ Μυσίας ἐξελθόντες Ἕλληνες ἀνάγονται, καὶ χειμῶνος ἐπιγενομένου σφοδροῦ διαζευχθέντες ἀλλήλων εἰς τὰς πατρίδας καταντῶσιν. ὑποστρεψάντων οὖν τῶν Ἑλλήνων τότε λέγεται τὸν πόλεμον εἰκοσαετῆ γενέσθαι: μετὰ γὰρ τὴν Ἑλένης ἁρπαγὴν ἔτει δευτέρῳ τοὺς Ἕλληνας παρασκευασαμένους στρατεύεσθαι, ἀναχωρήσαντας δὲ ἀπὸ Μυσίας εἰς Ἑλλάδα μετὰ ἔτη ὀκτὼ πάλιν εἰς Ἄργος μεταστραφέντας ἐλθεῖν εἰς Αὐλίδα.

[18] Departing from Mysia, the Greeks put to sea, and a violent storm coming on, they were separated from each other and landed in their own countries. So the Greeks returned at that time, and it is said that the war lasted twenty years. For it was in the second year after the rape of Helen that the Greeks, having completed their preparations, set out on the expedition and after their retirement from Mysia to Greece eight years elapsed before they again returned to Argos and came to Aulis.

[19] συνελθόντων δὲ αὐτῶν ἐν Ἄργει αὖθις μετὰ τὴν ῥηθεῖσαν ὀκταετίαν, ἐν ἀπορίᾳ τοῦ πλοῦ πολλῇ καθεστήκεσαν, καθηγεμόνα μὴ ἔχοντες, ὃς ἦν δυνατὸς δεῖξαι τὴν εἰς Τροίαν.

[19] Having again assembled at Aulis after the aforesaid interval of eight years, they were in great perplexity about the voyage, because they had no leader who could show them the way to Troy.

[20] Τήλεφος δὲ ἐκ τῆς Μυσίας, ἀνίατον τὸ τραῦμα ἔχων, εἰπόντος αὐτῷ τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος τότε τεύξεσθαι θεραπείας, ὅταν ὁ τρώσας ἰατρὸς γένηται, τρύχεσιν ἠμφιεσμένος εἰς Ἄργος ἀφίκετο, καὶ δεηθεὶς Ἀχιλλέως καὶ ὑπεσχημένος τὸν εἰς Τροίαν πλοῦν δεῖξαι θεραπεύεται ἀποξύσαντος Ἀχιλλέως τῆς Πηλιάδος μελίας τὸν ἰόν. θεραπευθεὶς οὖν ἔδειξε τὸν πλοῦν, τὸ τῆς δείξεως ἀσφαλὲς πιστουμένου τοῦ Κάλχαντος διὰ τῆς ἑαυτοῦ μαντικῆς.

[20] But Telephus, because his wound was unhealed, and Apollo had told him that he would be cured when the one who wounded him should turn physician, came from Mysia to Argos, clad in rags, and begged the help of Achilles, promising to show the course to steer for Troy. So Achilles healed him by scraping off the rust of his Pelian spear. Accordingly, on being healed, Telephus showed the course to steer, and the accuracy of his information was confirmed by Calchas by means of his own art of divination.

[21] ἀναχθέντων δὲ αὐτῶν ἀπ᾽ Ἄργους καὶ παραγενομένων τὸ δεύτερον εἰς Αὐλίδα,τὸν στόλον ἄπλοια κατεῖχε: Κάλχας δὲ ἔφη οὐκ ἄλλως δύνασθαι πλεῖν αὐτούς, εἰ μὴ τῶν Ἀγαμέμνονος θυγατέρων ἡ κρατιστεύουσα κάλλει σφάγιον Ἀρτέμιδι παραστῇ, διὰ τὸ μηνίειν τὴν θεὸν τῷ Ἀγαμέμνονι, ὅτι τε βαλὼν ἔλαφον εἶπεν: οὐδὲ ἡ Ἄρτεμις, καὶ ὅτι Ἀτρεὺς οὐκ ἔθυσεν αὐτῇ τὴν χρυσῆν ἄρνα.

[21] But when they had put to sea from Argos and arrived for the second time at Aulis, the fleet was windbound, and Calchas said that they could not sail unless the fairest of Agamemnon’s daughters were presented as a sacrifice to Artemis; for the goddess was angry with Agamemnon, both because, on shooting a deer, he had said, “ Artemis herself could not （ do it better）,” and because Atreus had not sacrificed to her the golden lamb.

[22] τοῦ δὲ χρησμοῦ τούτου γενομένου, πέμψας Ἀγαμέμνων πρὸς Κλυταιμνήστραν Ὀδυσσέα καὶ Ταλθύβιον Ἰφιγένειαν ᾔτει, λέγων ὑπεσχῆσθαι δώσειν αὐτὴν Ἀχιλλεῖ γυναῖκα μισθὸν τῆς στρατείας.πεμψάσης δὲ ἐκείνης Ἀγαμέμνων τῷ βωμῷ παραστήσας ἔμελλε σφάζειν,Ἄρτεμις δὲ αὐτὴν ἁρπάσασα εἰς Ταύρους ἱέρειαν ἑαυτῆς κατέστησεν, ἔλαφον ἀντ᾽ αὐτῆς παραστήσασα τῷ βωμῷ:ὡς δὲ ἔνιοι λέγουσιν, ἀθάνατον αὐτὴν ἐποίησεν.

[22] On receipt of this oracle, Agamemnon sent Ulysses and Talthybius to Clytaemnestra and asked for Iphigenia, alleging a promise of his to give her to Achilles to wife in reward for his military service. So Clytaemnestra sent her, and Agamemnon set her beside the altar, and was about to slaughter her, when Artemis carried her off to the Taurians and appointed her to be her priestess, substituting a deer for her at the altar; but some say that Artemis made her immortal.

[23] οἱ δὲ ἀναχθέντες ἐξ Αὐλίδος προσέσχον Τενέδῳ. ταύτης ἐβασίλευε Τένης ὁ Κύκνου καὶ Προκλείας, ὡς δέ τινες Ἀπόλλωνος: οὗτος ὑπὸ τοῦ πατρὸς φυγαδευθεὶς ἐνταῦθα κατῴκει.

[23] After putting to sea from Aulis they touched at Tenedos. It was ruled by Tenes, son of Cycnus and Proclia, but according to some, he was a son of Apollo. He dwelt there because he had been banished by his father.

[24] Κύκνος γὰρ ἔχων ἐκ Προκλείας τῆς Λαομέδοντος παῖδα μὲν Τένην, θυγατέρα δὲ Ἡμιθέαν, ἐπέγημε τὴν Τραγάσου Φιλονόμην: ἥτις Τένου ἐρασθεῖσα καὶ μὴ πείθουσα καταψεύδεται πρὸς Κύκνον αὐτοῦ φθοράν, καὶ τούτου μάρτυρα παρεῖχεν αὐλητὴν Εὔμολπον ὄνομα.

[24] For Cycnus had a son Tenes and a daughter Hemithea by Proclia, daughter of Laomedon, but he afterwards married Philonome, daughter of Tragasus; and she fell in love with Tenes, and, failing to seduce him, falsely accused him to Cycnus of attempting to debauch her, and in witness of it she produced a flute-player, by name Eumolpus.

[25] Κύκνος δὲ πιστεύσας, ἐνθέμενος αὐτὸν μετὰ τῆς ἀδελφῆς εἰς λάρνακα μεθῆκεν εἰς τὸ πέλαγος: προσσχούσης δὲ αὐτῆς Λευκόφρυι νήσῳ ἐκβὰς ὁ Τένης κατῴκησε ταύτην καὶ ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ Τένεδον ἐκάλεσε. Κύκνος δὲ ὕστερον ἐπιγνοὺς τὴν ἀλήθειαν τὸν μὲν αὐλητὴν κατέλευσε, τὴν δὲ γυναῖκα ζῶσαν εἰς γῆν κατέχωσε.

[25] Cycnus believed her, and putting him and his sister in a chest he set them adrift on the sea. The chest was washed up on the island of Leucophrys, and Tenes landed and settled in the island, and called it Tenedos after himself. But Cycnus afterwards learning the truth, stoned the flute-player to death and buried his wife alive in the earth.

[26] προσπλέοντας οὖν Τενέδῳ τοὺς Ἕλληνας ὁρῶν Τένης ἀπεῖργε βάλλων πέτρους, καὶ ὑπὸ Ἀχιλλέως ξίφει πληγεὶς κατὰ τὸ στῆθος θνήσκει, καίτοι Θέτιδος προειπούσης Ἀχιλλεῖ μὴ κτεῖναι Τένην: τεθνήξεσθαι γὰρ ὑπὸ Ἀπόλλωνος αὐτόν, ἐὰν κτείνῃ Τένην.

[26] So when the Greeks were standing in for Tenedos, Tenes saw them and tried to keep them off by throwing stones, but was killed by Achilles with a sword-cut in the breast, though Thetis had forewarned Achilles not to kill Tenes, because he himself would die by the hand of Apollo if he slew Tenes.

[27] τελούντων δὲ αὐτῶν Ἀπόλλωνι θυσίαν, ἐκ τοῦ βωμοῦ προσελθὼν ὕδρος δάκνει Φιλοκτήτην: ἀθεραπεύτου δὲ τοῦ ἕλκους καὶ δυσώδους γενομένου τῆς τε ὀδμῆς οὐκ ἀνεχομένου τοῦ στρατοῦ, Ὀδυσσεὺς αὐτὸν εἰς Λῆμνον μεθ᾽ ὧν εἶχε τόξων Ἡρακλείων ἐκτίθησι κελεύσαντος Ἀγαμέμνονος. ὁ δὲ ἐκεῖ τὰ πτηνὰ τοξεύων ἐπὶ τῆς ἐρημίας τροφὴν εἶχεν.

[27] and as they were offering a sacrifice to Apollo, a water-snake approached from the altar and bit Philoctetes; and as the sore did not heal and grew noisome, the army could not endure the stench, and Ulysses, by the orders of Agamemnon, put him ashore on the island of Lemnos, with the bow of Hercules which he had in his possession; and there, by shooting birds with the bow, he subsisted in the wilderness.

[28] ἀναχθέντες δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς Τενέδου προσέπλεον Τροίᾳ, καὶ πέμπουσιν Ὀδυσσέα καὶ Μενέλαον τὴν Ἑλένην καὶ τὰ χρήματα ἀπαιτοῦντας. συναθροισθείσης δὲ παρὰ τοῖς Τρωσὶν ἐκκλησίας, οὐ μόνον τὴν Ἑλένην οὐκ ἀπεδίδουν ἀλλὰ καὶ τούτους κτείνειν ἤθελον.

[28] Putting to sea from Tenedos they made sail for Troy, and sent Ulysses and Menelaus to demand the restoration of Helen and the property. But the Trojans, having summoned an assembly, not only refused to restore Helen, but threatened to kill the envoys.

[29] ἀλλὰ τοὺς μὲν ἔσωσεν Ἀντήνωρ, οἱ δὲ Ἕλληνες, ἀχθόμενοι ἐπὶ τῇ τῶν βαρβάρων καταφρονήσει, ἀναλαβόντες τὴν πανοπλίαν ἔπλεον ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς. Ἀχιλλεῖ δὲ ἐπιστέλλει Θέτις πρῶτον μὴ ἀποβῆναι τῶν νεῶν: τὸν γὰρ ἀποβάντα πρῶτον πρῶτον μέλλειν τελευτήσειν.πυθόμενοι δὲ οἱ βάρβαροι τὸν στόλον ἐπιπλεῖν, σὺν ὅπλοις ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν ὥρμησαν καὶ βάλλοντες πέτροις ἀποβῆναι ἐκώλυον.

[29] These were, however, saved by Antenor; but the Greeks, exasperated at the insolence of the barbarians, stood to arms and made sail against them. Now Thetis charged Achilles not to be the first to land from the ships, because the first to land would be the first to die. Being apprized of the hostile approach of the fleet, the barbarians marched in arms to the sea, and endeavored by throwing stones to prevent the landing.

[30] τῶν δὲ Ἑλλήνων πρῶτος ἀπέβη τῆς νεὼς Πρωτεσίλαος, καὶ κτείνας οὐκ ὀλίγους τῶν βαρβάρων ὑφ᾽ Ἕκτορος θνήσκει. τούτου ἡ γυνὴ Λαοδάμεια καὶ μετὰ θάνατον ἤρα, καὶ ποιήσασα εἴδωλον Πρωτεσιλάῳ παραπλήσιον τούτῳ προσωμίλει.Ἑρμῆς δὲ ἐλεησάντων θεῶν ἀνήγαγε Πρωτεσίλαον ἐξ Ἅιδου. Λαοδάμεια δὲ ἰδοῦσα καὶ νομίσασα αὐτὸν ἐκ Τροίας παρεῖναι τότε μὲν ἐχάρη, πάλιν δὲ ἐπαναχθέντος εἰς Ἅιδου ἑαυτὴν ἐφόνευσεν.

[30] Of the Greeks the first to land from his ship was Protesilaus, and having slain not a few of the barbarians, he fell by the hand of Hector. His wife Laodamia loved him even after his death, and she made an image of him and consorted with it. The gods had pity on her, and Hermes brought up Protesilaus from Hades. On seeing him, Laodamia thought it was himself returned from Troy, and she was glad; but when he was carried back to Hades, she stabbed herself to death.

[31] Πρωτεσιλάου δὲ τελευτήσαντος, ἐκβαίνει μετὰ Μυρμιδόνων Ἀχιλλεὺς καὶ λίθον βαλὼν εἰς τὴν κεφαλὴν Κύκνου κτείνει. ὡς δὲ τοῦτον νεκρὸν εἶδον οἱ βάρβαροι, φεύγουσιν εἰς τὴν πόλιν, οἱ δὲ Ἕλληνες ἐκπηδήσαντες τῶν νεῶν ἐνέπλησαν σωμάτων τὸ πεδίον. καὶ κατακλείσαντες τοὺς Τρῶας ἐπολιόρκουν:

[31] On the death of Protesilaus, Achilles landed with the Myrmidons, and throwing a stone at the head of Cycnus, killed him. When the barbarians saw him dead, they fled to the city, and the Greeks, leaping from their ships, filled the plain with bodies. and having shut up the Trojans, they besieged them; and they drew up the ships.

[32] ἀνέλκουσι δὲ τὰς ναῦς. μὴ θαρρούντων δὲ τῶν βαρβάρων, Ἀχιλλεὺς ἐνεδρεύσας Τρωίλον ἐν τῷ τοῦ Θυμβραίου Ἀπόλλωνος ἱερῷ φονεύει, καὶ νυκτὸς ἐλθὼν ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν Λυκάονα λαμβάνει. παραλαβὼν δὲ Ἀχιλλεύς τινας τῶν ἀριστέων τὴν χώραν ἐπόρθει, καὶ παραγίνεται εἰς Ἴδην ἐπὶ τὰς Αἰνείου τοῦ Πριάμου βόας. φυγόντος δὲ αὐτοῦ, τοὺς βουκόλους κτείνας καὶ Μήστορα τὸν Πριάμου τὰς βόας ἐλαύνει.

[32] The barbarians showing no courage, Achilles waylaid Troilus and slaughtered him in the sanctuary of Thymbraean Apollo, and coming by night to the city he captured Lycaon. Moreover, taking some of the chiefs with him, Achilles laid waste the country, and made his way to Ida to lift the kine of Aeneas. But Aeneas fled, and Achilles killed the neatherds and Nestor, son of Priam, and drove away the kine.

[33] αἱρεῖ δὲ καὶ Λέσβον καὶ Φώκαιαν, εἶτα Κολοφῶνα καὶ Σμύρναν καὶ Κλαζομενὰς καὶ Κύμην, μεθ᾽ ἃς Αἰγιαλὸν καὶ Τῆνον, τὰς ἑκατὸν καλουμένας πόλεις: εἶτα ἑξῆς Ἀδραμύτιον καὶ Σίδην, εἶτα Ἔνδιον καὶ Λιναῖον καὶ Κολώνην. αἱρεῖ δὲ καὶ Θήβας τὰς Ὑποπλακίας καὶ Λυρνησσόν, ἔτι δὲ καὶ Ἄντανδρον καὶ ἄλλας πολλάς.

[33] He also took Lesbos and Phocaea, then Colophon, and Smyrna, and Clazomenae, and Cyme; and afterwards Aegialus and Tenos, the so-called Hundred Cities; then, in order, Adramytium and Side; then Endium, and Linaeum, and Colone. He took also Hypoplacian Thebes and Lyrnessus, and further Antandrus, and many other cities.

[34] ἐνναετοῦς δὲ χρόνου διελθόντος παραγίνονται τοῖς Τρωσὶ σύμμαχοι: ἐκ τῶν περιοίκων πόλεων Αἰνείας Ἀγχίσου καὶ σὺν αὐτῷ Ἀρχέλοχος καὶ Ἀκάμας Ἀντήνορος καὶ Θεανοῦς, Δαρδανίων ἡγούμενοι, Θρᾳκῶν Ἀκάμας Εὐσώρου, Κικόνων Εὔφημος Τροιζήνου, Παιόνων Πυραίχμης, Παφλαγόνων Πυλαιμένης Βιλσάτου,

[34] A period of nine years having elapsed, allies came to join the Trojans: from the surrounding cities, Aeneas, son of Anchises, and with him Archelochus and Acamas, sons of Antenor, and Theanus, leaders of the Dardanians; of the Thracians, Acamas, son of Eusorus; of the Cicones, Euphemus, son of Troezenus; of the Paeonians, Pyraechmes; of the Paphlagonians, Pylaemenes, son of Bilsates;

[35] ἐκ Ζελίας Πάνδαρος Λυκάονος, ἐξ Ἀδραστείας Ἄδραστος καὶ Ἄμφιος Μέροπος, ἐκ δ᾽ Ἀρίσβης Ἄσιος Ὑρτάκου, ἐκ Λαρίσσης Ἱππόθοος Πελασγοῦ, ἐκ Μυσίας Χρόμιος καὶ Ἔννομος Ἀρσινόου, Ἀλιζώνων Ὀδίος καὶ Ἐπίστροφος Μηκιστέως, Φρυγῶν Φόρκυς καὶ Ἀσκάνιος Ἀρετάονος, Μαιόνων Μέσθλης καὶ Ἄντιφος Ταλαιμένους, Καρῶν Νάστης καὶ Ἀμφίμαχος Νομίονος, Λυκίων Σαρπηδὼν Διὸς καὶ Γλαῦκος Ἱππολόχου.

[35] from Zelia, Pandarus, son of Lycaon; from Adrastia, Adrastus and Amphius, sons of Merops; from Arisbe, Asius, son of Hyrtacus; from Larissa, Hippothous, son of Pelasgus; from Mysia, Chromius and Ennomus, sons of Arsinous; of the Alizones, Odius and Epistrophus, sons of Mecisteus; of the Phrygians, Phorcys and Ascanius, sons of Aretaon; of the Maeonians, Mesthles and Antiphus, sons of Talaemenes; of the Carians, Nastes and Amphimachus, sons of Nomion; of the Lycians, Sarpedon, son of Zeus, and Glaucus, son of Hippolochus.

[1] Ἀχιλλεὺς δὲ μηνίων ἐπὶ τὸν πόλεμον οὐκ ἐξῄει διὰ Βρισηίδα ... τῆς θυγατρὸς Χρύσου τοῦ ἱερέως. διὸ θαρσήσαντες οἱ βάρβαροι ἐκ τῆς πόλεως προῆλθον. καὶ μονομαχεῖ Ἀλέξανδρος πρὸς Μενέλαον, Ἀλέξανδρον δὲ ἡττώμενον ἁρπάζει Ἀφροδίτη. Πάνδαρος δὲ τοξεύσας Μενέλαον τοὺς ὅρκους ἔλυσεν.

[1] Achilles did not go forth to the war, because he was angry on account of Briseis, ... the daughter of Chryses the priest. Therefore the barbarians took heart of grace and sallied out of the city. And Alexander fought a single combat with Menelaus; and when Alexander got the worst of it, Aphrodite carried him off. And Pandarus, by shooting an arrow at Menelaus, broke the truce.

[2] ὅτι Διομήδης ἀριστεύων Ἀφροδίτην Αἰνείᾳ βοηθοῦσαν τιτρώσκει, καὶ Γλαύκῳ συστάς, ὑπομνησθεὶς πατρῴας φιλίας, ἀλλάσσει τὰ ὅπλα.προκαλουμένου δὲ Ἕκτορος τὸν ἄριστον εἰς μονομαχίαν, πολλῶν ἐλθόντων Αἴας κληρωσάμενος ἀριστεύει: νυκτὸς δὲ ἐπιγενομένης κήρυκες διαλύουσιν αὐτούς.

[2] Diomedes, doing doughty deeds, wounded Aphrodite when she came to the help of Aeneas; and encountering Glaucus, he recalled the friendship of their fathers and exchanged arms. And Hector having challenged the bravest to single combat, many came forward, but the lot fell on Ajax, and he did doughty deeds; but night coming on, the heralds parted them.

[3] οἱ δὲ Ἕλληνες πρὸς τοῦ ναυστάθμου τεῖχος ποιοῦνται καὶ τάφρον, καὶ γενομένης μάχης ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ οἱ Τρῶες τοὺς Ἕλληνας εἰς τὸ τεῖχος διώκουσιν: οἱ δὲ πέμπουσι πρὸς Ἀχιλλέα πρέσβεις Ὀδυσσέα καὶ Φοίνικα καὶ Αἴαντα, συμμαχεῖν ἀξιοῦντες καὶ Βρισηίδα καὶ ἄλλα δῶρα ὑπισχνούμενοι.

[3] The Greeks made a wall and a ditch to protect the roadstead, and a battle taking place in the plain, the Trojans chased the Greeks within the wall. But the Greeks sent Ulysses, Phoenix, and Ajax as ambassadors to Achilles, begging him to fight for them, and promising Briseis and other gifts.

[4] νυκτὸς δὲ ἐπιγενομένης κατασκόπους πέμπουσιν Ὀδυσσέα καὶ Διομήδην: οἱ δὲ ἀναιροῦσι Δόλωνα τὸν Εὐμήλου καὶ Ῥῆσον τὸν Θρᾷκα （ὃς πρὸ μιᾶς ἡμέρας παραγενόμενος Τρωσὶ σύμμαχος οὐ συμβαλὼν ἀπωτέρω τῆς Τρωικῆς δυνάμεως χωρὶς Ἕκτορος ἐστρατοπέδευσε） τούς τε περὶ αὐτὸν δώδεκα κοιμωμένους κτείνουσι καὶ τοὺς ἵππους ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς ἄγουσι.

[4] And night coming on, they sent Ulysses and Diomedes as spies; and these killed Dolon, son of Eumelus, and Rhesus, the Thracian （ who had arrived the day before as an ally of the Trojans, and having not yet engaged in the battle was encamped at some distance from the Trojan force and apart from Hector）; they also slew the twelve men that were sleeping around him, and drove the horses to the ships.

[5] μεθ᾽ ἡμέραν δὲ ἰσχυρᾶς μάχης γενομένης, τρωθέντων Ἀγαμέμνονος καὶ Διομήδους Ὀδυσσέως Εὐρυπύλου Μαχάονος καὶ τροπῆς τῶν Ἑλλήνων γενομένης, Ἕκτωρ ῥήξας τὸ τεῖχος εἰσέρχεται καὶ ἀναχωρήσαντος Αἴαντος πῦρ ἐμβάλλει ταῖς ναυσίν.

[5] But by day a fierce fight took place; Agamemnon and Diomedes, Ulysses, Eurypylus, and Machaon were wounded, the Greeks were put to flight Hector made a breach in the wall and entered and, Ajax having retreated, he set fire to the ships.

[6] ὡς δὲ εἶδεν Ἀχιλλεὺς τὴν Πρωτεσιλάου ναῦν καιομένην, ἐκπέμπει Πάτροκλον καθοπλίσας τοῖς ἰδίοις ὅπλοις μετὰ τῶν Μυρμιδόνων, δοὺς αὐτῷ τοὺς ἵππους. ἰδόντες δὲ αὐτὸν οἱ Τρῶες καὶ νομίσαντες Ἀχιλλέα εἶναι εἰς φυγὴν τρέπονται. καταδιώξας δὲ αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸ τεῖχος πολλοὺς ἀναιρεῖ, ἐν οἷς καὶ Σαρπηδόνα τὸν Διός, καὶ ὑφ᾽ Ἕκτορος ἀναιρεῖται, τρωθεὶς πρότερον ὑπὸ Εὐφόρβου.

[6] But when Achilles saw the ship of Protesilaus burning, he sent out Patroclus with the Myrmidons, after arming him with his own arms and giving him the horses. Seeing him the Trojans thought that he was Achilles and turned to flee. And having chased them within the wall, he killed many, amongst them Sarpedon, son of Zeus, and was himself killed by Hector, after being first wounded by Euphorbus.

[7] μάχης δὲ ἰσχυρᾶς γενομένης περὶ τοῦ νεκροῦ, μόλις Αἴας ἀριστεύσας σώζει τὸ σῶμα. Ἀχιλλεὺς δὲ τὴν ὀργὴν ἀποθέμενος καὶ τὴν Βρισηίδα κομίζεται. καὶ πανοπλίας αὐτῷ κομισθείσης παρὰ Ἡφαίστου, καθοπλισάμενος ἐπὶ τὸν πόλεμον ἐξέρχεται, καὶ συνδιώκει τοὺς Τρῶας ἐπὶ τὸν Σκάμανδρον, κἀκεῖ πολλοὺς μὲν ἄλλους ἀναιρεῖ, κτείνει δὲ καὶ Ἀστεροπαῖον τὸν Πηλεγόνος τοῦ Ἀξιοῦ ποταμοῦ: καὶ αὐτῷ λάβρος ὁ ποταμὸς ἐφορμᾷ. καὶ τούτου μὲν ὁ Ἥφαιστος τὰ ῥεῖθρα ἀναξηραίνει πολλῇ φλογὶ διώξας, ὁ δ᾽ Ἀχιλλεὺς Ἕκτορα ἐκ μονομαχίας ἀναιρεῖ καὶ ἐξάψας αὐτοῦ τὰ σφυρὰ ἐκ τοῦ ἅρματος σύρων ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς παραγίνεται. καὶ θάψας Πάτροκλον ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ ἀγῶνα τίθησιν, ἐν ᾧ νικᾷ ἵπποις Διομήδης, Ἐπειὸς πυγμῇ, Αἴας καὶ Ὀδυσσεὺς πάλῃ. μετὰ δὲ τὸν ἀγῶνα παραγενόμενος Πρίαμος πρὸς Ἀχιλλέα λυτροῦται τὸ Ἕκτορος σῶμα καὶ θάπτει.

[7] And a fierce fight taking place for the corpse, Ajax with difficulty, by performing feats of valor, rescued the body. And Achilles laid aside his anger and recovered Briseis. And a suit of armour having been brought him from Hephaestus, he donned the armour and went forth to the war, and chased the Trojans in a crowd to the Scamander, and there killed many, and amongst them Asteropaeus, son of Pelegon, son of the river Axius; and the river rushed at him in fury. But Hephaestus dried up the streams of the river, after chasing them with a mighty flame. And Achilles slew Hector in single combat, and fastening his ankles to his chariot dragged him to the ships. And having buried Patroclus, he celebrated games in his honor, at which Diomedes was victorious in the chariot race, Epeus in boxing, and Ajax and Ulysses in wrestling. And after the games Priam came to Achilles and ransomed the body of Hector, and buried it.

[1] ὅτι Πενθεσίλεια, Ὀτρηρῆς καὶ Ἄρεος, ἀκουσίως Ἱππολύτην κτείνασα καὶ ὑπὸ Πριάμου καθαρθεῖσα, μάχης γενομένης πολλοὺς κτείνει, ἐν οἷς καὶ Μαχάονα: εἶθ᾽ ὕστερον θνήσκει ὑπὸ Ἀχιλλέως, ὅστις μετὰ θάνατον ἐρασθεὶς τῆς Ἀμαζόνος κτείνει Θερσίτην λοιδοροῦντα αὐτόν.

[1] Penthesilia, daughter of Otrere and Ares, accidentally killed Hippolyte and was purified by Priam. In battle she slew many, and amongst them Machaon, and was afterwards herself killed by Achilles, who fell in love with the Amazon after her death and slew Thersites for jeering at him.

[2] ἦν δὲ Ἱππολύτη ἡ τοῦ Ἱππολύτου μήτηρ, ἡ καὶ Γλαύκη καὶ Μελανίππη. αὕτη γάρ, ἐπιτελουμένων τῶν γάμων Φαίδρας, ἐπιστᾶσα σὺν ὅπλοις ἅμα ταῖς μεθ᾽ ἑαυτῆς Ἀμαζόσιν ἔλεγε κτείνειν τοὺς συνανακειμένους Θησεῖ. μάχης οὖν γενομένης ἀπέθανεν, εἴτε ὑπὸ τῆς συμμάχου Πενθεσιλείας ἀκούσης, εἴτε ὑπὸ Θησέως, εἴτε ὅτι οἱ περὶ Θησέα, τὴν τῶν Ἀμαζόνων ἑωρακότες ἐπιστασίαν, κλείσαντες διὰ τάχους τὰς θύρας καὶ ταύτην ἀπολαβόντες ἐντὸς ἀπέκτειναν.

[2] Hippolyte was the mother of Hippolytus; she also goes by the names of Glauce and Melanippe. For when the marriage of Phaedra was being celebrated, Hippolyte appeared in arms with her Amazons, and said that she would slay the guests of Theseus. So a battle took place, and she was killed, whether involuntarily by her ally Penthesilia, or by Theseus, or because his men, seeing the threatening attitude of the Amazons, hastily closed the doors and so intercepted and slew her.

[3] ὅτι Μέμνονα τὸν Τιθωνοῦ καὶ Ἠοῦς μετὰ πολλῆς Αἰθιόπων δυνάμεως παραγενόμενον ἐν Τροίᾳ καθ᾽ Ἑλλήνων καὶ πολλοὺς τῶν Ἑλλήνων κτείναντα καὶ Ἀντίλοχον κτείνει ὁ Ἀχιλλεύς. διώξας δὲ καὶ τοὺς Τρῶας πρὸς ταῖς Σκαιαῖς πύλαις τοξεύεται ὑπὸ Ἀλεξάνδρου καὶ Ἀπόλλωνος εἰς τὸ σφυρόν.

[3] Memnon, the son of Tithonus and the Dawn, came with a great force of Ethiopians to Troy against the Greeks, and having slain many of the Greeks, including Antilochus, he was himself slain by Achilles. Having chased the Trojans also, Achilles was shot with an arrow in the ankle by Alexander and Apollo at the Scaean gate.

[4] γενομένης δὲ μάχης περὶ τοῦ νεκροῦ, Αἴας Γλαῦκον ἀναιρεῖ, καὶ τὰ ὅπλα δίδωσιν ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς κομίζειν, τὸ δὲ σῶμα βαστάσας Αἴας βαλλόμενος βέλεσι μέσον τῶν πολεμίων διήνεγκεν, Ὀδυσσέως πρὸς τοὺς ἐπιφερομένους μαχομένου.

[4] A fight taking place for the corpse, Ajax killed Glaucus, and gave the arms to be conveyed to the ships, but the body he carried, in a shower of darts, through the midst of the enemy, while Ulysses fought his assailants.

[5] Ἀχιλλέως δὲ ἀποθανόντος συμφορᾶς ἐπληρώθη τὸ στράτευμα.θάπτουσι δὲ αὐτὸν ἐν Λευκῇ νήσῳ μετὰ Πατρόκλου, τὰ ἑκατέρων ὀστᾶ συμμίξαντες. λέγεται δὲ μετὰ θάνατον Ἀχιλλεὺς ἐν Μακάρων νήσοις Μηδείᾳ συνοικεῖν.τιθέασι δὲ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ ἀγῶνα, ἐν ᾧ νικᾷ Εὔμηλος ἵπποις, Διομήδης σταδίῳ, Αἴας δίσκῳ, Τεῦκρος τόξῳ.

[5] The death of Achilles filled the army with dismay, and they buried him with Patroclus in the White Isle, mixing the bones of the two together. It is said that after death Achilles consorts with Medea in the Isles of the Blest. And they held games in his honor, at which Eumelus won the chariot-race, Diomedes the footrace, Ajax the quoit match, and Teucer the competition in archery.

[6] ἡ δὲ πανοπλία αὐτοῦ τῷ ἀρίστῳ νικητήριον τίθεται, καὶ καταβαίνουσιν εἰς ἅμιλλαν Αἴας καὶ Ὀδυσσεύς.καὶ κρινάντων τῶν Τρώων, ὡς δέ τινες τῶν συμμάχων,Ὀδυσσεὺς προκρίνεται. Αἴας δὲ ὑπὸ λύπης ταραχθεὶς ἐπιβουλεύεται νύκτωρ τῷ στρατεύματι, καὶ αὐτῷ μανίαν ἐμβαλοῦσα Ἀθηνᾶ εἰς τὰ βοσκήματα ἐκτρέπει ξιφήρη: ὁ δὲ ἐκμανεὶς σὺν τοῖς νέμουσι τὰ βοσκήματα ὡς Ἀχαιοὺς φονεύει.

[6] Also his arms were offered as a prize to the bravest, and Ajax and Ulysses came forward as competitors. The judges were the Trojans or, according to some, the allies, and Ulysses was preferred. Disordered by chagrin, Ajax planned a nocturnal attack on the army. And Athena drove him mad, and turned him, sword in hand, among the cattle, and in his frenzy he slaughtered the cattle with the herdsmen, taking them for the Achaeans.

[7] ὕστερον δὲ σωφρονήσας κτείνει καὶ ἑαυτόν. Ἀγαμέμνων δὲ κωλύει τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ καῆναι, καὶ μόνος οὗτος τῶν ἐν Ἰλίῳ ἀποθανόντων ἐν σορῷ κεῖται: ὁ δὲ τάφος ἐστὶν ἐν Ῥοιτείῳ.

[7] But afterwards he came to his senses and slew also himself. And Agamemnon forbade his body to be burnt; and he alone of all who fell at Ilium is buried, in a coffin. His grave is at Rhoeteum.

[8] ἤδη δὲ ὄντος τοῦ πολέμου δεκαετοῦς ἀθυμοῦσι τοῖς ἝλλησιΚάλχας θεσπίζει, οὐκ ἄλλως ἁλῶναι δύνασθαι Τροίαν, ἂν μὴ τὰ Ἡρακλέους ἔχωσι τόξα συμμαχοῦντα. τοῦτο ἀκούσας Ὀδυσσεὺς μετὰ Διομήδους εἰς Λῆμνον ἀφικνεῖται πρὸς Φιλοκτήτην, καὶ δόλῳ ἐγκρατὴς γενόμενος τῶν τόξων πείθει πλεῖν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ Τροίαν. ὁ δὲ παραγενόμενος καὶ θεραπευθεὶς ὑπὸ Ποδαλειρίου Ἀλέξανδρον τοξεύει.

[8] When the war had already lasted ten years, and the Greeks were despondent, Calchas prophesied to them that Troy could not be taken unless they had the bow and arrows of Hercules fighting on their side. On hearing that, Ulysses went with Diomedes to Philoctetes in Lemnos, and having by craft got possession of the bow and arrows he persuaded him to sail to Troy. So he went, and after being cured by Podalirius, he shot Alexander.

[9] τούτου δὲ ἀποθανόντος εἰς ἔριν ἔρχονται Ἕλενος καὶ Δηίφοβος ὑπὲρ τῶν Ἑλένης γάμων: προκριθέντος δὲ τοῦ Δηιφόβου Ἕλενος ἀπολιπὼν Τροίαν ἐν Ἴδῃ διετέλει. εἰπόντος δὲ Κάλχαντος Ἕλενον εἰδέναι τοὺς ῥυομένους τὴν πόλιν χρησμούς, ἐνεδρεύσας αὐτὸν Ὀδυσσεὺς καὶ χειρωσάμενος ἐπὶ τὸ στρατόπεδον ἤγαγε:

[9] After the death of Alexander, Helenus and Deiphobus quarrelled as to which of them should marry Helen; and as Deiphobus was preferred, Helenus left Troy and abode in Ida. But as Chalcas said that Helenus knew the oracles that protected the city, Ulysses waylaid and captured him and brought him to the camp;

[10] καὶ ἀναγκαζόμενος ὁ Ἕλενος λέγει πῶς ἂν αἱρεθείη ἡ Ἴλιος, πρῶτον μὲν εἰ τὰ Πέλοπος ὀστᾶ κομισθείη παρ᾽ αὐτούς, ἔπειτα εἰ Νεοπτόλεμος συμμαχοίη, τρίτον εἰ τὸ διιπετὲς παλλάδιον ἐκκλαπείη: τούτου γὰρ ἔνδον ὄντος οὐ δύνασθαι τὴν πόλιν ἁλῶναι.

[10] and Helenus was forced to tell how Ilium could be taken, to wit, first, if the bones of Pelops were brought to them; next, if Neoptolemus fought for them; and third, if the Palladium, which had fallen from heaven, were stolen from Troy, for while it was within the walls the city could not be taken.

[11] ταῦτα ἀκούσαντες Ἕλληνες τὰ μὲν Πέλοπος ὀστᾶ μετακομίζουσιν, Ὀδυσσέα δὲ καὶ Φοίνικα πρὸς Λυκομήδην πέμπουσιν εἰς Σκῦρον, οἱ δὲ πείθουσι αὐτὸν Νεοπτόλεμον προέσθαι. παραγενόμενος δὲ οὗτος εἰς τὸ στρατόπεδον καὶ λαβὼν παρ᾽ ἑκόντος Ὀδυσσέως τὴν τοῦ πατρὸς πανοπλίαν πολλοὺς τῶν Τρώων ἀναιρεῖ.

[11] On hearing these things the Greeks caused the bones of Pelops to be fetched, and they sent Ulysses and Phoenix to Lycomedes at Scyros, and these two persuaded him to let Neoptolemus go. On coming to the camp and receiving his father’s arms from Ulysses, who willingly resigned them, Neoptolemus slew many of the Trojans.

[12] ἀφικνεῖται δὲ ὕστερον Τρωσὶ σύμμαχος Εὐρύπυλος ὁ Τηλέφου πολλὴν Μυσῶν δύναμιν ἄγων: τοῦτον ἀριστεύσαντα Νεοπτόλεμος ἀπέκτεινεν.

[12] Afterwards, Eurypylus, son of Telephus, arrived to fight for the Trojans, bringing a great force of Mysians. He performed doughty deeds, but was slain by Neoptolemus.

[13] Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ μετὰ Διομήδους παραγενόμενος νύκτωρ εἰς τὴν πόλιν Διομήδην μὲν αὐτοῦ μένειν εἴα, αὐτὸς δὲ ἑαυτὸν αἰκισάμενος καὶ πενιχρὰν στολὴν ἐνδυσάμενος ἀγνώστως εἰς τὴν πόλιν εἰσέρχεται ὡς ἐπαίτης: γνωρισθεὶς δὲ ὑπὸ Ἑλένης δι᾽ ἐκείνης τὸ παλλάδιον ἔκλεψε καὶ πολλοὺς κτείνας τῶν φυλασσόντων ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς μετὰ Διομήδους κομίζει.

[13] And Ulysses went with Diomedes by night to the city, and there he let Diomedes wait, and after disfiguring himself and putting on mean attire he entered unknown into the city as a beggar. And being recognized by Helen, he with her help stole away the Palladium, and after killing many of the guards, brought it to the ships with the aid of Diomedes.

[14] ὕστερον δὲ ἐπινοεῖ δουρείου ἵππου κατασκευὴν καὶ ὑποτίθεται Ἐπειῷ, ὃς ἦν ἀρχιτέκτων: οὗτος ἀπὸ τῆς Ἴδης ξύλα τεμὼν ἵππον κατασκευάζει κοῖλον ἔνδοθεν εἰς τὰς πλευρὰς ἀνεῳγμένον. εἰς τοῦτον Ὀδυσσεὺς εἰσελθεῖν πείθει πεντήκοντα τοὺς ἀρίστους, ὡς δὲ ὁ τὴν μικρὰν γράψας Ἰλιάδα φησί, τρισχιλίους, τοὺς δὲ λοιποὺς γενομένης νυκτὸς ἐμπρήσαντας τὰς σκηνάς, ἀναχθέντας περὶ τὴν Τένεδον ναυλοχεῖν καὶ μετὰ τὴν ἐπιοῦσαν νύκτα καταπλεῖν.

[14] But afterwards he invented the construction of the Wooden Horse and suggested it to Epeus, who was an architect. Epeus felled timber on Ida, and constructed the horse with a hollow interior and an opening in the sides. Into this horse Ulysses persuaded fifty （ or, according to the author of the Little Iliad, three thousand） of the doughtiest to enter, while the rest, when night had fallen, were to burn their tents, and, putting to sea, to lie to off Tenedos, but to sail back to land after the ensuing night.

[15] οἱ δὲ πείθονται καὶ τοὺς μὲν ἀρίστους ἐμβιβάζουσιν εἰς τὸν ἵππον, ἡγεμόνα καταστήσαντες αὐτῶν Ὀδυσσέα, γράμματα ἐγχαράξαντες τὰ δηλοῦντα: τῆς εἰς οἶκον ἀνακομιδῆς Ἕλληνες Ἀθηνᾷ χαριστήριον. αὐτοὶ δὲ ἐμπρήσαντες τὰς σκηνὰς καὶ καταλιπόντες Σίνωνα, ὃς ἔμελλεν αὐτοῖς πυρσὸν ἀνάπτειν, τῆς νυκτὸς ἀνάγονται καὶ περὶ Τένεδον ναυλοχοῦσιν.

[15] They followed the advice of Ulysses and introduced the doughtiest into the horse, after appointing Ulysses their leader and engraving on the horse an inscription which signified, “ For their return home, the Greeks dedicate this thank — offering to Athena.” But they themselves burned their tents, and leaving Sinon, who was to light a beacon as a signal to them, they put to sea by night, and lay to off Tenedos.

[16] ἡμέρας δὲ γενομένης ἔρημον οἱ Τρῶες τὸ τῶν Ἑλλήνων στρατόπεδον θεασάμενοι καὶ νομίσαντες αὐτοὺς πεφευγέναι, περιχαρέντες εἷλκον τὸν ἵππον καὶ παρὰ τοῖς Πριάμου βασιλείοις στήσαντες ἐβουλεύοντο τί χρὴ ποιεῖν.

[16] And at break of day, when the Trojans beheld the camp of the Greeks deserted and believed that they had fled, they with great joy dragged the horse, and stationing it beside the palace of Priam deliberated what they should do.

[17] Κασάνδρας δὲ λεγούσης ἔνοπλον ἐν αὐτῷ δύναμιν εἶναι, καὶ προσέτι Λαοκόωντος τοῦ μάντεως, τοῖς μὲν ἐδόκει κατακαίειν, τοῖς δὲ κατὰ βαράθρων ἀφιέναι: δόξαν δὲ τοῖς πολλοῖς ἵνα αὐτὸν ἐάσωσι θεῖον ἀνάθημα, τραπέντες ἐπὶ θυσίαν εὐωχοῦντο.

[17] As Cassandra said that there was an armed force in it, and she was further confirmed by Laocoon, the seer, some were for burning it, and others for throwing it down a precipice; but as most were in favour of sparing it as a votive offering sacred to a divinity, they betook them to sacrifice and feasting.

[18] Ἀπόλλων δὲ αὐτοῖς σημεῖον ἐπιπέμπει: δύο γὰρ δράκοντες διανηξάμενοι διὰ τῆς θαλάσσης ἐκ τῶν πλησίον νήσων τοὺς Λαοκόωντος υἱοὺς κατεσθίουσιν.

[18] However, Apollo sent them a sign; for two serpents swam through the sea from the neighboring islands and devoured the sons of Laocoon.

[19] ὡς δὲ ἐγένετο νὺξ καὶ πάντας ὕπνος κατεῖχεν, οἱ ἀπὸ Τενέδου προσέπλεον, καὶ Σίνων αὐτοῖς ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἀχιλλέως τάφου πυρσὸν ἧπτεν. Ἑλένη δὲ ἐλθοῦσα περὶ τὸν ἵππον, μιμουμένη τὰς φωνὰς ἑκάστης τῶν γυναικῶν, τοὺς ἀριστέας ἐκάλει. ὑπακοῦσαι δὲ Ἀντίκλου θέλοντος Ὀδυσσεὺς τὸ στόμα κατέσχεν.

[19] And when night fell, and all were plunged in sleep, the Greeks drew near by sea from Tenedos, and Sinon kindled the beacon on the grave of Achilles to guide them. And Helen, going round the horse, called the chiefs, imitating the voices of each of their wives. But when Anticlus would have answered, Ulysses held fast his mouth.

[20] ὡς δ᾽ ἐνόμισαν κοιμᾶσθαι τοὺς πολεμίους, ἀνοίξαντες σὺν τοῖς ὅπλοις ἐξῄεσαν: καὶ πρῶτος μὲν Ἐχίων Πορθέως ἀφαλλόμενος ἀπέθανεν, οἱ δὲ λοιποὶ σειρᾷ ἐξάψαντες ἑαυτοὺς ἐπὶ τὰ τείχη παρεγένοντο καὶ τὰς πύλας ἀνοίξαντες ὑπεδέξαντο τοὺς ἀπὸ Τενέδου καταπλεύσαντας.

[20] and when they thought that their foes were asleep, they opened the horse and came forth with their arms. The first, Echion, son of Portheus, was killed by leaping from it; but the rest let themselves down by a rope, and lighted on the walls, and having opened the gates they admitted their comrades who had landed from Tenedos.

[21] χωρήσαντες δὲ μεθ᾽ ὅπλων εἰς τὴν πόλιν, εἰς τὰς οἰκίας ἐπερχόμενοι κοιμωμένους ἀνῄρουν. καὶ Νεοπτόλεμος μὲν ἐπὶ τοῦ ἑρκείου Διὸς βωμοῦ καταφεύγοντα Πρίαμον ἀνεῖλεν:Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ καὶ Μενέλαος Γλαῦκον τὸν Ἀντήνορος εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν φεύγοντα γνωρίσαντες μεθ᾽ ὅπλων ἐλθόντες ἔσωσαν. Αἰνείας δὲ Ἀγχίσην τὸν πατέρα βαστάσας ἔφυγεν, οἱ δὲ Ἕλληνες αὐτὸν διὰ τὴν εὐσέβειαν εἴασαν.

[21] And marching, arms in hand, into the city, they entered the houses and slew the sleepers. Neoptolemus slew Priam, who had taken refuge at the altar of Zeus of the Courtyard. But when Glaucus, son of Antenor, fled to his house, Ulysses and Menelaus recognized and rescued him by their armed intervention. Aeneas took up his father Anchises and fled, and the Greeks let him alone on account of his piety.

[22] Μενέλαος δὲ Δηίφοβον κτείνας Ἑλένην ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς ἄγει: ἀπάγουσι δὲ καὶ τὴν Θησέως μητέρα Αἴθραν οἱ Θησέως παῖδεσΔημοφῶν καὶ Ἀκάμας: καὶ γὰρ τούτους λέγουσιν εἰς Τροίαν ἐλθεῖν ὕστερον. Αἴας δὲ ὁ Λοκρὸς Κασάνδραν ὁρῶν περιπεπλεγμένην τῷ ξοάνῳ τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς βιάζεται: διὰ τοῦτο τὸ ξόανον εἰς οὐρανὸν βλέπειν.

[22] But Menelaus slew Deiphobus and led away Helen to the ships; and Aethra, mother of Theseus, was also led away by Demophon and Acamas, the sons of Theseus; for they say that they afterwards went to Troy. And the Locrian Ajax, seeing Cassandra clinging to the wooden image of Athena, violated her; therefore they say that the image looks to heaven.

[23] κτείναντες δὲ τοὺς Τρῶας τὴν πόλιν ἐνέπρησαν καὶ τὰ λάφυρα ἐμερίσαντο. καὶ θύσαντες πᾶσι τοῖς θεοῖς Ἀστυάνακτα ἀπὸ τῶν πύργων ἔρριψαν, Πολυξένην δὲ ἐπὶ τῷ Ἀχιλλέως τάφῳ κατέσφαξαν. λαμβάνει δὲ Ἀγαμέμνων μὲν κατ᾽ ἐξαίρετον Κασάνδραν, Νεοπτόλεμος δὲ Ἀνδρομάχην, Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ Ἑκάβην. ὡς δὲ ἔνιοι λέγουσιν, Ἕλενος αὐτὴν λαμβάνει, καὶ διακομισθεὶς εἰς Χερρόνησον σὺν αὐτῇ κύνα γενομένην θάπτει, ἔνθα νῦν λέγεται Κυνὸς σῆμα. Λαοδίκην μὲν γὰρ κάλλει τῶν Πριάμου θυγατέρων διαφέρουσαν βλεπόντων πάντων γῆ χάσματι ἀπέκρυψεν.ὡς δὲ ἔμελλον ἀποπλεῖν πορθήσαντες Τροίαν, ὑπὸ Κάλχαντος κατείχοντο, μηνίειν Ἀθηνᾶν αὐτοῖς λέγοντος διὰ τὴν Αἴαντος ἀσέβειαν.καὶ τὸν μὲν Αἴαντα κτείνειν ἔμελλον, φεύγοντα δὲ ἐπὶ βωμὸν εἴασαν.

[23] And having slain the Trojans, they set fire to the city and divided the spoil among them. And having sacrificed to all the gods, they threw Astyanax from the battlements and slaughtered Polyxena on the grave of Achilles. And as special awards Agamemnon got Cassandra, Neoptolemus got Andromache, and Ulysses got Hecuba. But some say that Helenus got her, and crossed over with her to the Chersonese; and that there she turned into a bitch, and he buried her at the place now called the Bitch’s Tomb. As for Laodice, the fairest of the daughters of Priam, she was swallowed up by a chasm in the earth in the sight of all. When they had laid Troy waste and were about to sail away, they were detained by Calchas, who said that Athena was angry with them on account of the impiety of Ajax. And they would have killed Ajax, but he fled to the altar and they let him alone.

[1] καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα συνελθόντων εἰς ἐκκλησίαν, Ἀγαμέμνων καὶ Μενέλαος ἐφιλονείκουν, Μενελάου λέγοντος ἀποπλεῖν, Ἀγαμέμνονος δὲ ἐπιμένειν κελεύοντος καὶ θύειν Ἀθηνᾷ.ἀναχθέντες δὲ Διομήδης καὶ Νέστωρ καὶ Μενέλαος ἅμα, οἱ μὲν εὐπλοοῦσιν, ὁ δὲ Μενέλαος χειμῶνι περιπεσών, τῶν λοιπῶν ἀπολομένων σκαφῶν, πέντε ναυσὶν ἐπ᾽ Αἴγυπτον ἀφικνεῖται.

[1] After these things they met in assembly, and Agamemnon and Menelaus quarrelled, Menelaus advising that they should sail away, and Agamemnon insisting that they should stay and sacrifice to Athena. When they put to sea, Diomedes, Nestor, and Menelaus in company, the two former had a prosperous voyage, but Menelaus was overtaken by a storm, and after losing the rest of his vessels, arrived with five ships in Egypt.

[2] Ἀμφίλοχος δὲ καὶ Κάλχας καὶ Λεοντεὺς καὶ Ποδαλείριος καὶ Πολυποίτης ἐν Ἰλίῳ τὰς ναῦς ἀπολιπόντες ἐπὶ Κολοφῶνα πεζῇ πορεύονται, κἀκεῖ θάπτουσι Κάλχαντα τὸν μάντιν: ἦν γὰρ αὐτῷ λόγιον τελευτήσειν, ἐὰν ἑαυτοῦ σοφωτέρῳ περιτύχῃ μάντει.

[2] But Amphilochus, and Calchas, and Leonteus, and Podalirius, and Polypoetes left their ships in Ilium and journeyed by land to Colophon, and there buried Calchas the diviner; for it was foretold him that he would die if he met with a wiser diviner than himself.

[3] ὑποδεχθέντων οὖν ὑπὸ Μόψου μάντεως, ὃς Ἀπόλλωνος καὶ Μαντοῦς παῖς ὑπῆρχεν, οὗτος ὁ Μόψος περὶ μαντικῆς ἤρισε Κάλχαντι. καὶ Κάλχαντος ἀνακρίναντος ἐρινεοῦ ἑστώσης ‘πόσους ὀλύνθους φέρει;’ ὁ Μόψος: ‘μυρίους’ ἔφη ‘καὶ μέδιμνον καὶ ἕνα ὄλυνθον περισσόν:’

[3] Well, they were lodged by the diviner Mopsus, who was a son of Apollo and Manto, and he wrangled with Calchas about the art of divination. A wild fig-tree grew on the spot, and when Calchas asked, “ How many figs does it bear?” Mopsus answered, “ Ten thousand, and a bushel, and one fig over,” and they were found to be so.

[4] καὶ εὑρέθησαν οὕτω. Μόψος δὲ συὸς οὔσης ἐπιτόκου ἠρώτα Κάλχαντα, πόσους χοίρους κατὰ γαστρὸς ἔχει καὶ πότε τέκοι:τοῦ δὲ εἰπόντος: ‘ὀκτώ,’ μειδιάσας ὁ Μόψος ἔφη: ‘Κάλχας τῆς ἀκριβοῦς μαντείας ἀπεναντιῶς διακεῖται, ἐγὼ δ᾽ Ἀπόλλωνος καὶ Μαντοῦς παῖς ὑπάρχων τῆς ἀκριβοῦς μαντείας τὴν ὀξυδορκίαν πάντως πλουτῶ, καὶ οὐχ ὡς ὁ Κάλχας ὀκτώ, ἀλλ᾽ ἐννέα κατὰ γαστρός, καὶ τούτους ἄρρενας ὅλους ἔχειν μαντεύομαι, καὶ αὔριον ἀνυπερθέτως ἐν ἕκτῃ ὥρᾳ τεχθήσεσθαι.’ὧν γενομένων Κάλχας ἀθυμήσας ἀπέθανεκαὶ ἐτάφη ἐν Νοτίῳ.

[4] And when Mopsus asked Calchas concerning a pregnant sow, “ How many pigs has she in her womb, and when will she farrow?” Calchas answered, “ Eight.” But Mopsus smiled and said,” The divination of Calchas is the reverse of exact; but I, as a son of Apollo and Manto, am extremely rich in the sharp sight which comes of exact divination, and I divine that the number of pigs in the womb is not eight, as Calchas says, but nine, and that they are all male and will be farrowed without fail tomorrow at the sixth hour.” So when these things turned out so, Calchas died of a broken heart and was buried at Notium.

[5] Ἀγαμέμνων δὲ θύσας ἀνάγεται καὶ Τενέδῳ προσίσχει, Νεοπτόλεμον δὲ πείθει Θέτις ἀφικομένη ἐπιμεῖναι δύο ἡμέρας καὶ θυσιάσαι, καὶ ἐπιμένει. οἱ δὲ ἀνάγονται καὶ περὶ Τῆνον χειμάζονται. Ἀθηνᾶ γὰρ ἐδεήθη Διὸς τοῖς Ἕλλησι χειμῶνα ἐπιπέμψαι. καὶ πολλαὶ νῆες βυθίζονται.

[5] After sacrificing, Agamemnon put to sea and touched at Tenedos. But Thetis came and persuaded Neoptolemus to wait two days and to offer sacrifice; and he waited. But the others put to sea and encountered a storm at Tenos; for Athena entreated Zeus to send a tempest against the Greeks; and many ships foundered.

[6] Ἀθηνᾶ δὲ ἐπὶ τὴν Αἴαντος ναῦν κεραυνὸν βάλλει, ὁ δὲ τῆς νεὼς διαλυθείσης ἐπί τινα πέτραν διασωθεὶς παρὰ τὴν θεοῦ ἔφη πρόνοιαν σεσῶσθαι. Ποσειδῶν δὲ πλήξας τῇ τριαίνῃ τὴν πέτραν ἔσχισεν, ὁ δὲ πεσὼν εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν τελευτᾷ, καὶ ἐκβρασθέντα θάπτει Θέτις ἐν Μυκόνῳ.

[6] And Athena threw a thunderbolt at the ship of Ajax; and when the ship went to pieces he made his way safe to a rock, and declared that he was saved in spite of the intention of Athena. But Poseidon smote the rock with his trident and split it, and Ajax fell into the sea and perished; and his body, being washed up, was buried by Thetis in Myconos.

[7] τῶν δὲ ἄλλων Εὐβοίᾳ προσφερομένων νυκτὸς Ναύπλιος ἐπὶ τοῦ Καφηρέως ὄρους πυρσὸν ἀνάπτει: οἱ δὲ νομίσαντες εἶναί τινας τῶν σεσωσμένων προσπλέουσι, καὶ περὶ τὰς Καφηρίδας πέτρας θραύεται τὰ σκάφη καὶ πολλοὶ τελευτῶσιν.

[7] The others being driven to Euboea by night, Nauplius kindled a beacon on Mount Caphareus; and they, thinking it was some of those who were saved, stood in for the shore, and the vessels were wrecked on the Capherian rocks, and many men perished.

[8] ὁ γὰρ τοῦ Ναυπλίου καὶ Κλυμένης τῆς Κατρέως υἱὸς Παλαμήδης ἐπιβουλαῖς Ὀδυσσέως λιθοβοληθεὶς ἀναιρεῖται. τοῦτο μαθὼν Ναύπλιος ἔπλευσε πρὸς τοὺς Ἕλληνας καὶ τὴν τοῦ παιδὸς ἀπῄτει ποινήν:

[8] For Palamedes, the son of Nauplius and Clymene daughter of Catreus, had been stoned to death through the machinations of Ulysses. And when Nauplius learned of it, he sailed to the Greeks and claimed satisfaction for the death of his son;

[9] ἄπρακτος δὲ ὑποστρέψας, ὡς πάντων χαριζομένων τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἀγαμέμνονι, μεθ᾽ οὗ τὸν Παλαμήδην ἀνεῖλεν Ὀδυσσεύς, παραπλέων τὰς χώρας τὰς Ἑλληνίδας παρεσκεύασε τὰς τῶν Ἑλλήνων γυναῖκας μοιχευθῆναι, Κλυταιμνήστραν Αἰγίσθῳ, Αἰγιάλειαν τῷ Σθενέλου Κομήτῃ, τὴν Ἰδομενέως Μήδαν ὑπὸ Λεύκου:

[9] but when he returned unsuccessful （ for they all favoured King Agamemnon, who had been the accomplice of Ulysses in the murder of Palamedes）, he coasted along the Grecian lands and contrived that the wives of the Greeks should play their husbands false, Clytaemnestra with Aegisthus, Aegialia with Cometes, son of Sthenelus, and Meda, wife of Idomeneus, with Leucus.

[10] ἣν καὶ ἀνεῖλε Λεῦκος ἅμα Κλεισιθύρᾳ τῇ θυγατρὶ ταύτης ἐν τῷ ναῷ προσφυγούσῃ, καὶ δέκα πόλεις ἀποσπάσας τῆς Κρήτης ἐτυράννησε: καὶ μετὰ τὸν Τρωικὸν πόλεμον καὶ τὸν Ἰδομενέα κατάραντα τῇ Κρήτῃ ἐξήλασε.

[10] But Leucus killed her, together with her daughter Clisithyra, who had taken refuge in the temple; and having detached ten cities from Crete he made himself tyrant of them; and when after the Trojan war Idomeneus landed in Crete, Leucus drove him out.

[11] ταῦτα πρότερον κατασκευάσας ὁ Ναύπλιος, ὕστερον μαθὼν τὴν εἰς τὰς πατρίδας τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἐπάνοδον, τὸν εἰς τὸν Καφηρέα, νῦν δὲ Ξυλοφάγον λεγόμενον, ἀνῆψε φρυκτόν: ἔνθα προσπελάσαντες Ἕλληνες ἐν τῷ δοκεῖν λιμένα εἶναι διεφθάρησαν.

[11] These were the earlier contrivances of Nauplius; but afterwards, when he learned that the Greeks were on their way home to their native countries, he kindled the beacon fire on Mount Caphereus, which is now called Xylophagus; and there the Greeks, standing in shore in the belief that it was a harbor, were cast away.

[12] Νεοπτόλεμος δὲ μείνας ἐν Τενέδῳ δύο ἡμέρας ὑποθήκαις τῆς Θέτιδος εἰς Μολοσσοὺς πεζῇ ἀπῄει μετὰ Ἑλένου, καὶ παρὰ τὴν ὁδὸν ἀποθανόντα Φοίνικα θάπτει, καὶ νικήσας μάχῃ Μολοσσοὺς βασιλεύει, καὶ ἐξ Ἀνδρομάχης γεννᾷ Μολοσσόν.

[12] After remaining in Tenedos two days at the advice of Thetis, Neoptolemus set out for the country of the Molossians by land with Helenus, and on the way Phoenix died, and Neoptolemus buried him; and having vanquished the Molossians in battle he reigned as king and begat Molossus on Andromache. And

[13] Ἕλενος δὲ κτίσας ἐν τῇ Μολοσσίᾳ πόλιν κατοικεῖ, καὶ δίδωσιν αὐτῷ Νεοπτόλεμος εἰς γυναῖκα τὴν μητέρα Δηιδάμειαν. Πηλέως δὲ ἐκ Φθίας ἐκβληθέντος ὑπὸ τῶν Ἀκάστου παίδων καὶ ἀποθανόντος, Νεοπτόλεμος τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ πατρὸς παρέλαβε.

[13] Helenus founded a city in Molossia and inhabited it, and Neoptolemus gave him his mother Deidamia to wife. And when Peleus was expelled from Phthia by the sons of Acastus and died, Neoptolemus succeeded to his father’s kingdom.

[14] καὶ μανέντος Ὀρέστου ἁρπάζει τὴν ἐκείνου γυναῖκα Ἑρμιόνην κατηγγυημένην αὐτῷ πρότερον ἐν Τροίᾳ, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ἐν Δελφοῖς ὑπὸ Ὀρέστου κτείνεται. ἔνιοι δὲ αὐτόν φασι παραγενόμενον εἰς Δελφοὺς ἀπαιτεῖν ὑπὲρ τοῦ πατρὸς τὸν Ἀπόλλωνα δίκας καὶ συλᾶν τὰ ἀναθήματα καὶ τὸν νεὼν ἐμπιμπράναι, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ὑπὸ Μαχαιρέως τοῦ Φωκέως ἀναιρεθῆναι.

[14] And when Orestes went mad, Neoptolemus carried off his wife Hermione, who had previously been betrothed to him in Troy; and for that reason he was slain by Orestes at Delphi. But some say that he went to Delphi to demand satisfaction from Apollo for the death of his father, and that he rifled the votive offerings and set fire to the temple, and was on that account slain by Machaereus the Phocian.

[15] ὅτι πλανηθέντες Ἕλληνες ἄλλοι ἀλλαχοῦ κατάραντες κατοικοῦσιν, οἱ μὲν εἰς Λιβύην, οἱ δὲ εἰς Ἰταλίαν, εἰς Σικελίαν ἕτεροι, τινὲς δὲ πρὸς τὰς πλησίον Ἰβηρίας νήσους, ἄλλοι παρὰ τὸν Σαγγάριον ποταμόν: εἰσὶ δὲ οἳ καὶ Κύπρον ᾤκησαν.τῶν δὲ ναυαγησάντων περὶ τὸν Καφηρέα ἄλλος ἀλλαχῆ φέρεται, Γουνεὺς μὲν εἰς Λιβύην, Ἄντιφος δὲ ὁ Θεσσαλοῦ εἰς Πελασγοὺς καὶ τὴν χώραν κατασχὼν Θεσσαλίαν ἐκάλεσεν, ὁ δὲ Φιλοκτήτης πρὸς Ἰταλίαν εἰς Καμπανούς, Φείδιππος μετὰ τῶν Κῴων ἐν Ἄνδρῳ κατῴκησεν, Ἀγαπήνωρ ἐν Κύπρῳ, καὶ ἄλλος ἀλλαχοῦ. [15α] “Ἀπολλόδωρος δὲ καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ οὕτω φασί: Γουνεὺς εἰς Λιβύην λιπὼν τὰς ἑαυτοῦ ναῦς ἐλθὼν ἐπὶ Κίνυφα ποταμὸν κατοικεῖ. Μέγης δὲ καὶ Πρόθοος ἐν Εὐβοίᾳ περὶ τὸν Καφηρέα σὺν πολλοῖς ἑτέροις διαφθείρεται ... τοῦ δὲ Προθόου περὶ τὸν Καφηρέα ναυαγήσαντος, οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ Μάγνητες εἰς Κρήτην ῥιφέντες ᾤκησαν. “ Tzetzes, Scholia on Lycophron, 902[15β] “μετὰ δὲ τὴν Ἰλίου πόρθησιν Μενεσθεὺς Φείδιππός τε καὶ Ἄντιφος καὶ οἱ Ἐλεφήνορος καὶ Φιλοκτήτης μέχρι Μίμαντος κοινῇ ἔπλευσαν. εἶτα Μενεσθεὺς μὲν εἰς Μῆλον ἐλθὼν βασιλεύει, τοῦ ἐκεῖ βασιλέως Πολυάνακτος τελευτήσαντος. Ἄντιφος δὲ ὁ Θεσσαλοῦ εἰς Πελασγοὺς ἐλθὼν καὶ τὴν χώραν κατασχὼν Θεσσαλίαν ἐκάλεσε. Φείδιππος δὲ μετὰ Κῴων ἐξωσθεὶς περὶ τὴν Ἄνδρον, εἶτα περὶ Κύπρον ἐκεῖ κατῴκησεν.

[15] After their wanderings the Greeks landed and settled in various countries, some in Libya, some in Italy, others in Sicily, and some in the islands near Iberia, others on the banks of the Sangarius river; and some settled also in Cyprus. And of those that were shipwrecked at Caphereus, some drifted one way and some another. Guneus went to Libya; Antiphus, son of Thessalus, went to the Pelasgians, and, having taken possession of the country, called it Thessaly. Philoctetes went to the Campanians in Italy; Phidippus with the Coans settled in Andros, Agapenor in Cyprus, and others elsewhere. [15a]” Apollodorus and the rest say as follows. Guneus left his own ships, and having come to the Cinyps river in Libya he dwelt there. But Meges and Prothous, with many others, were cast away at Caphereus in Euboea... and when Prothous was shipwrecked at Caphereus, the Magnesians with him drifted to Crete and settled there.”Tzetzes, Scholia on Lycophron, 902[15b]” After the sack of Ilium, Menestheus, Phidippus and Antiphus, and the people of Elephenor, and Philoctetes sailed together as far as Mimas. Then Menestheus went to Melos and reigned as king, because the king there, Polyanax, had died. And Antiphus the son of Thessalus went to the Pelasgians, and having taken possession of the country he called it Thessaly. Phidippus with the Coans was driven first to Andros, and then to Cyprus, where he settled. Elephenor died in Troy, but his people were cast away in the Ionian gulf and inhabited Apollonia in Epirus. And the people of Tlepolemus touched at Crete; then they were driven out of their course by winds and settled in the Iberian islands. ...The people of Protesilaus were cast away on Pellene near the plain of Canastrum. And Philoctetes was driven to Campania in Italy, and after making war on the Lucanians, he settled in Crimissa, near Croton and Thurium; and, his wanderings over, he founded a sanctuary of Apollo the Wanderer （Alaios）, to whom also he dedicated his bow, as Euphorion says.”Tzetzes, Scholia on Lycophron, 911[15c]” Navaethus is a river of Italy. It was called so, according to Apollodorus and the rest, because after the capture of Ilium the daughters of Laomedon, the sisters of Priam, to wit, Aethylla, Astyoche, and Medesicaste, with the other female captives, finding themselves in that part of Italy, and dreading slavery in Greece, set fire to the vessels; whence the river was called Navaethus and the women were called Nauprestides; and the Greeks who were with the women, having lost the vessels, settled there.”Tzetzes, Scholia on Lycophron, 921

[16] Δημοφῶν δὲ Θρᾳξὶ Βισάλταις μετ᾽ ὀλίγων νεῶν προσίσχει, καὶ αὐτοῦ ἐρασθεῖσα Φυλλὶς ἡ θυγάτηρ τοῦ βασιλέως ἐπὶ προικὶ τῇ βασιλείᾳ συνευνάζεται ὑπὸ τοῦ πατρός. ὁ δὲ βουλόμενος εἰς τὴν πατρίδα ἀπιέναι, πολλὰ δεηθεὶς ὀμόσας ἀναστρέψειν ἀπέρχεται: καὶ Φυλλὶς αὐτὸν ἄχρι τῶν Ἐννέα ὁδῶν λεγομένων προπέμπει καὶ δίδωσιν αὐτῷ κίστην, εἰποῦσα ἱερὸν τῆς μητρὸς Ῥέας ἐνεῖναι, καὶ ταύτην μὴ ἀνοίγειν, εἰ μὴ ὅταν ἀπελπίσῃ τῆς πρὸς αὐτὴν ἀνόδου.

[16] Demophon with a few ships put in to the land of the Thracian Bisaltians, and there Phyllis, the king’s daughter, falling in love with him, was given him in marriage by her father with the kingdom for her dower. But he wished to depart to his own country, and after many entreaties and swearing to return, he did depart. And Phyllis accompanied him as far as what are called the Nine Roads, and she gave him a casket, telling him that it contained a sacrament of Mother Rhea, and that he was not to open it until he should have abandoned all hope of returning to her.

[17] Δημοφῶν δὲ ἐλθὼν εἰς Κύπρον ἐκεῖ κατῴκει. καὶ τοῦ τακτοῦ χρόνου διελθόντος Φυλλὶς ἀρὰς θεμένη κατὰ Δημοφῶντος ἑαυτὴν ἀναιρεῖ: Δημοφῶν δὲ τὴν κίστην ἀνοίξας φόβῳ κατασχεθεὶς ἄνεισιν ἐπὶ τὸν ἵππον καὶ τοῦτον ἐλαύνων ἀτάκτως ἀπόλλυται: τοῦ γὰρ ἵππου σφαλέντος κατενεχθεὶς ἐπὶ τὸ ξίφος ἔπεσεν. οἱ δὲ σὺν αὐτῷ κατῴκησαν ἐν Κύπρῳ.

[17] And Demophon went to Cyprus and dwelt there. And when the appointed time was past, Phyllis called down curses on Demophon and killed herself; and Demophon opened the casket, and, being struck with fear, he mounted his horse and galloping wildly met his end; for, the horse stumbling, he was thrown and fell on his sword. But his people settled in Cyprus.

[18] Ποδαλείριος δὲ ἀφικόμενος εἰς Δελφοὺς ἐχρᾶτο ποῦ κατοικήσει: χρησμοῦ δὲ δοθέντος, εἰς ἣν πόλιν τοῦ περιέχοντος οὐρανοῦ πεσόντος οὐδὲν πείσεται, τῆς Καρικῆς Χερρονήσου τὸν πέριξ οὐρανοῦ κυκλούμενον ὄρεσι τόπον κατῴκησεν.

[18] Podalirius went to Delphi and inquired of the oracle where he should settle; and on receiving an oracle that he should settle in the city where, if the encompassing heaven were to fall, he would suffer no harm, he settled in that place of the Carian Chersonnese which is encircled by mountains all round the horizon.

[19] Ἀμφίλοχος δὲ ὁ Ἀλκμαίωνος, κατά τινας ὕστερον παραγενόμενος εἰς Τροίαν, κατὰ τὸν χειμῶνα ἀπερρίφη πρὸς Μόψον, καί, ὥς τινες λέγουσιν, ὑπὲρ τῆς βασιλείας μονομαχοῦντες ἔκτειναν ἀλλήλους.

[19] Amphilochus son of Alcmaeon, who, according to some, arrived later at Troy, was driven in the storm to the home of Mopsus; and, as some say, they fought a single combat for the kingdom, and slew each other.

[20] Λοκροὶ δὲ μόλις τὴν ἑαυτῶν καταλαβόντες, ἐπεὶ μετὰ τρίτον ἔτος τὴν Λοκρίδα κατέσχε φθορά, δέχονται χρησμὸν ἐξιλάσασθαι τὴν ἐν Ἰλίῳ Ἀθηνᾶν καὶ δύο παρθένους πέμπειν ἱκέτιδας ἐπὶ ἔτη χίλια. καὶ λαγχάνουσι πρῶται Περίβοια καὶ Κλεοπάτρα.

[20] The Locrians regained their own country with difficulty, and three years afterwards, when Locris was visited by a plague, they received an oracle bidding them to propitiate Athena at Ilium and to send two maidens as suppliants for a thousand years. The lot first fell on Periboea and Cleopatra.

[21] αὗται δὲ εἰς Τροίαν ἀφικόμεναι, διωκόμεναι παρὰ τῶν ἐγχωρίων εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν κατέρχονται: καὶ τῇ μὲν θεᾷ οὐ προσήρχοντο, τὸ δὲ ἱερὸν ἔσαιρόν τε καὶ ἔρραινον: ἐκτὸς δὲ τοῦ νεὼ οὐκ ἐξῄεσαν, κεκαρμέναι δὲ ἦσαν καὶ μονοχίτωνες καὶ ἀνυπόδετοι.

[21] And when they came to Troy they were chased by the natives and took refuge in the sanctuary. And they did not approach the goddess, but swept and sprinkled the sanctuary; and they did not go out of the temple, and their hair was cropped, and they wore single garments and no shoes.

[22] τῶν δὲ πρώτων ἀποθανουσῶν ἄλλας ἔπεμπον: εἰσῄεσαν δὲ εἰς τὴν πόλιν νύκτωρ, ἵνα μὴ φανεῖσαι τοῦ τεμένους ἔξω φονευθῶσι: μετέπειτα δὲ βρέφη μετὰ τροφῶν ἔπεμπον. χιλίων δὲ ἐτῶν παρελθόντων μετὰ τὸν Φωκικὸν πόλεμον ἱκέτιδας ἐπαύσαντο πέμποντες.

[22] And when the first maidens died, they sent others; and they entered into the city by night, lest, being seen outside the precinct, they should be put to the sword; but afterwards they sent babes with their nurses. And when the thousand years were passed, after the Phocian war they ceased to send suppliants.

[23] Ἀγαμέμνων δὲ καταντήσας εἰς Μυκήνας μετὰ Κασάνδρας ἀναιρεῖται ὑπὸ Αἰγίσθου καὶ Κλυταιμνήστρας: δίδωσι γὰρ αὐτῷ χιτῶνα ἄχειρα καὶ ἀτράχηλον, καὶ τοῦτον ἐνδυόμενος φονεύεται, καὶ βασιλεύει Μυκηνῶν Αἴγισθος: κτείνουσι δὲ καὶ Κασάνδραν.

[23] After Agamemnon had returned to Mycenae with Cassandra, he was murdered by Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra; for she gave him a shirt without sleeves and without a neck, and while he was putting it on he was cut down, and Aegisthus reigned over Mycenae. And they killed Cassandra also.

[24] Ἠλέκτρα δὲ μία τῶν Ἀγαμέμνονος θυγατέρων Ὀρέστην τὸν ἀδελφὸν ἐκκλέπτει καὶ δίδωσι Στροφίῳ Φωκεῖ τρέφειν, ὁ δὲ αὐτὸν ἐκτρέφει μετὰ Πυλάδου παιδὸς ἰδίου. τελειωθεὶς δὲ Ὀρέστης εἰς Δελφοὺς παραγίνεται καὶ τὸν θεὸν ἐρωτᾷ, εἰ τοὺς αὐτόχειρας τοῦ πατρὸς μετέλθοι.

[24] But Electra, one of Agamemnon’s daughters, smuggled away her brother Orestes and gave him to Strophius, the Phocian, to bring up; and he brought him up with Pylades, his own son. And when Orestes was grown up, he repaired to Delphi and asked the god whether he should take vengeance on his father’s murderers.

[25] τοῦτο δὲ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐπιτρέποντος ἀπέρχεται εἰς Μυκήνας μετὰ Πυλάδου λαθραίως καὶ κτείνει τήν τε μητέρα καὶ τὸν Αἴγισθον, καὶ μετ᾽ οὐ πολὺ μανίᾳ κατασχεθεὶς ὑπὸ Ἐρινύων διωκόμενος εἰς Ἀθήνας παραγίνεται καὶ κρίνεται ἐν Ἀρείῳ πάγῳ,ὡς μὲν λέγουσί τινες ὑπὸ Ἐρινύων, ὡς δέ τινες ὑπὸ Τυνδάρεω, ὡς δέ τινες ὑπὸ Ἠριγόνης τῆς Αἰγίσθου καὶ Κλυταιμνήστρας, καὶ κριθεὶς ἴσων γενομένων τῶν ψήφων ἀπολύεται.

[25] The god gave him leave, so he departed secretly to Mycenae in company with Pylades, and killed both his mother and Aegisthus. And not long afterwards, being afflicted with madness and pursued by the Furies, he repaired to Athens and was tried in the Areopagus. He is variously said to have been brought to trial by the Furies, or by Tyndareus, or by Erigone, daughter of Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra; and the votes at his trial being equal he was acquitted.

[26] ἐρομένῳ δὲ αὐτῷ, πῶς ἂν ἀπαλλαγείη τῆς νόσου, ὁ θεὸς εἶπεν, εἰ τὸ ἐν Ταύροις ξόανον μετακομίσειεν.οἱ δὲ Ταῦροι μοῖρά ἐστι Σκυθῶν, οἳ τοὺς ξένους φονεύουσι καὶ εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν πῦρ ῥίπτουσι. τοῦτο ἦν ἐν τῷ τεμένει διά τινος πέτρας ἀναφερόμενον ἐξ Ἅιδου.

[26] When he inquired how he should be rid of his disorder, the god answered that he would be rid of it if he should fetch the wooden image that was in the land of the Taurians. Now the Taurians are a part of the Scythians, who murder strangers and throw them into the sacred fire, which was in the precinct, being wafted up from Hades through a certain rock.

[27] παραγενόμενος οὖν εἰς Ταύρους Ὀρέστης μετὰ Πυλάδου φωραθεὶς ἑάλω καὶ ἄγεται πρὸς Θόαντα τὸν βασιλέα δέσμιος, ὁ δὲ ἀμφοτέρους πρὸς τὴν ἱέρειαν ἀποστέλλει. ἐπιγνωσθεὶς δὲ ὑπὸ τῆς ἀδελφῆς ἱερὰ ποιούσης ἐν Ταύροις, ἄρας τὸ ξόανον σὺν αὐτῇ φεύγει.κομισθὲν δὲ εἰς Ἀθήνας νῦν λέγεται τὸ τῆς Ταυροπόλου: ἔνιοι δὲ αὐτὸν κατὰ χειμῶνα προσενεχθῆναι τῇ νήσῳ Ῥόδῳ λέγουσιν ... αὐτὸν καὶ κατὰ χρησμὸν ἐν τείχει καθοσιωθῆναι.

[27] So when Orestes was come with Pylades to the land of the Taurians, he was detected, caught, and carried in bonds before Thoas the king, who sent them both to the priestess. But being recognized by his sister, who acted as priestess among the Taurians, he fled with her, carrying off the wooden image. It was conveyed to Athens and is now called the image of Tauropolus. But some say that Orestes was driven in a storm to the island of Rhodes, ... and in accordance with an oracle the image was dedicated in a fortification wall.

[28] καὶ δὴ ἐλθὼν εἰς Μυκήνας Πυλάδῃ μὲν τὴν ἀδελφὴν Ἠλέκτραν συζεύγνυσιν, αὐτὸς δὲ γήμας Ἑρμιόνην, ἢ κατά τινας Ἠριγόνην, τεκνοῖ Τισαμενόν,καὶ δηχθεὶς ὑπὸ ὄφεως ἐν Ὀρεστείῳ τῆς Ἀρκαδίας θνήσκει.

[28] and having come to Mycenae, he united his sister Electra in marriage to Pylades, and having himself married Hermione, or, according to some, Erigone, he begat Tisamenus, and was killed by the bite of a snake at Oresteum in Arcadia.

[29] Μενέλαος δὲ πέντε ναῦς τὰς πάσας ἔχων μεθ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ προσσχὼν Σουνίῳ τῆς Ἀττικῆς ἀκρωτηρίῳ κἀκεῖθεν εἰς Κρήτην ἀπορριφεὶς πάλιν ὑπὸ ἀνέμων μακρὰν ἀπωθεῖται, καὶ πλανώμενος ἀνά τε Λιβύην καὶ Φοινίκην καὶ Κύπρον καὶ Αἴγυπτον πολλὰ συναθροίζει χρήματα. καὶ κατά τινας εὑρίσκεται παρὰ Πρωτεῖ τῷ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων βασιλεῖ Ἑλένη, μέχρι τότε εἴδωλον ἐκ νεφῶν ἐσχηκότος τοῦ Μενελάου. ὀκτὼ δὲ πλανηθεὶς ἔτη κατέπλευσεν εἰς Μυκήνας, κἀκεῖ κατέλαβεν Ὀρέστην μετεληλυθότα τὸν τοῦ πατρὸς φόνον. ἐλθὼν δὲ εἰς Σπάρτην τὴν ἰδίαν ἐκτήσατο βασιλείαν. καὶἀποθανατισθεὶς ὑπὸ Ἥρας εἰς τὸ Ἠλύσιον ἦλθε πεδίον μεθ᾽ Ἑλένης.

[29] Menelaus, with five ships in all under his command, put in at Sunium, a headland of Attica; and being again driven thence by winds to Crete he drifted far away, and wandering up and down Libya, and Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Egypt, he collected much treasure. And according to some, he discovered Helen at the court of Proteus, king of Egypt; for till then Menelaus had only a phantom of her made of clouds. And after wandering for eight years he came to port at Mycenae, and there found Orestes, who had avenged his father’s murder. And having come to Sparta he regained his own kingdom, and being made immortal by Hera he went to the Elysian Fields with Helen.

[1] ὁ δὲ Ὀδυσσεύς, ὡς μὲν ἔνιοι λέγουσιν, ἐπλανᾶτο κατὰ Λιβύην, ὡς δὲ ἔνιοι κατὰ Σικελίαν, ὡς δὲ ἄλλοι κατὰ τὸν Ὠκεανὸν ἢ κατὰ τὸ Τυρρηνικὸν πέλαγος.

[1] Ulysses, as some say, wandered about Libya, or, as some say, about Sicily, or, as others say, about the ocean or about the Tyrrhenian Sea.

[2] ἀναχθεὶς δὲ ἀπὸ Ἰλίου προσίσχει πόλει Κικόνων Ἰσμάρῳ καὶ ταύτην αἱρεῖ πολεμῶν καὶ λαφυραγωγεῖ, μόνου φεισάμενος Μάρωνος, ὃς ἦν ἱερεὺς Ἀπόλλωνος. αἰσθόμενοι δὲ οἱ τὴν ἤπειρον οἰκοῦντες Κίκονες σὺν ὅπλοις ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν παραγίνονται: ἀφ᾽ ἑκάστης δὲ νεὼς ἓξ ἀποβαλὼν ἄνδρας ἀναχθεὶς ἔφευγε.

[2] And putting to sea from Ilium, he touched at Ismarus, a city of the Cicones, and captured it in war, and pillaged it, sparing Maro alone, who was priest of Apollo. And when the Cicones who inhabited the mainland heard of it, they came in arms to withstand him, and having lost six men from each ship he put to sea and fled.

[3] καὶ καταντᾷ εἰς τὴν Λωτοφάγων χώραν καὶ πέμπει τινὰς μαθησομένους τοὺς κατοικοῦντας: οἱ δὲ γευσάμενοι τοῦ λωτοῦ κατέμειναν: ἐφύετο γὰρ ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ καρπὸς ἡδὺς λεγόμενος λωτός, ὃς τῷ γευσαμένῳ πάντων ἐποίει λήθην. Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ αἰσθόμενος, τοὺς λοιποὺς κατασχών, τοὺς γευσαμένους μετὰ βίας ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς ἄγει, καὶ προσπλεύσας τῇ Κυκλώπων γῇ προσπελάζει.

[3] And he landed in the country of the Lotus-eaters, and sent some to learn who inhabited it, but they tasted of the lotus and remained there; for there grew in the country a sweet fruit called lotus, which caused him who tasted it to forget everything. When Ulysses was informed of this, he restrained the rest of his men, and dragged those who had tasted the lotus by force to the ships. And having sailed to the land of the Cyclopes, he stood in for the shore.

[4] καταλιπὼν δὲ τὰς λοιπὰς ναῦς ἐν τῇ πλησίον νήσῳ, μίαν ἔχων τῇ Κυκλώπων γῇ προσπελάζει, μετὰ δώδεκα ἑταίρων ἀποβὰς τῆς νεώς. ἔστι δὲ τῆς θαλάσσης πλησίον ἄντρον, εἰς ὃ ἔρχεται ἔχων ἀσκὸν οἴνου τὸν ὑπὸ Μάρωνος αὐτῷ δοθέντα. ἦν δὲ Πολυφήμου τὸ ἄντρον, ὃς ἦν Ποσειδῶνος καὶ Θοώσης νύμφης, ἀνὴρ ὑπερμεγέθης ἄγριος ἀνδροφάγος, ἔχων ἕνα ὀφθαλμὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ μετώπου.

[4] And having left the rest of the ships in the neighboring island, he stood in for the land of the Cyclopes with a single ship, and landed with twelve companions. And near the sea was a cave which he entered, taking with him the skin of wine that had been given him by Maro. Now the cave belonged to Polyphemus, who was a son of Poseidon and the nymph Thoosa, a huge, wild, cannibal man, with one eye on his forehead.

[5] ἀνακαύσαντες δὲ πῦρ καὶ τῶν ἐρίφων θύσαντες εὐωχοῦντο. ἐλθὼν δὲ ὁ Κύκλωψ καὶ εἰσελάσας τὰ ποίμνια τῇ μὲν θύρᾳ προσέθηκε πέτρον ὑπερμεγέθη καὶ θεασάμενος αὐτοὺς ἐνίους κατήσθιεν.

[5] And having lit a fire and sacrificed some of the kids, they feasted. But the Cyclops came, and when he had driven in his flocks, he put a huge stone to the door, and perceiving the men he ate some of them.

[6] Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ αὐτῷ δίδωσιν ἐκ τοῦ Μάρωνος οἴνου πιεῖν: ὁ δὲ πιὼν πάλιν ᾔτησε, καὶ πιὼν τὸ δεύτερον ἐπηρώτα τὸ ὄνομα. τοῦ δὲ εἰπόντος ὅτι Οὔτις καλεῖται, Οὔτιν ἠπείλει ὕστερον ἀναλῶσαι, τοὺς δὲ ἄλλους ἔμπροσθεν, καὶ τοῦτο αὐτῷ ξένιον ἀποδώσειν ὑπέσχετο. κατασχεθεὶς δὲ ὑπὸ μέθης ἐκοιμήθη.

[6] But Ulysses gave him of Maro’s wine to drink, and when he had drunk, he asked for another draught, and when he had drunk the second, he inquired his name; and when Ulysses said that he was called Nobody, he threatened to devour Nobody last and the others first, and that was the token of friendship which he promised to give him in return. And being overcome by wine, he fell asleep.

[7] Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ εὑρὼν ῥόπαλον κείμενον σὺν τέσσαρσιν ἑταίροις ἀπώξυνε καὶ πυρώσας ἐξετύφλωσεν αὐτόν. ἐπιβοωμένου δὲ Πολυφήμου τοὺς πέριξ Κύκλωπας, παραγενόμενοι ἐπηρώτων τίς αὐτὸν ἀδικεῖ. τοῦ δὲ εἰπόντος ‘Οὔτις,’ νομίσαντες αὐτὸν λέγειν ‘ὑπὸ μηδενός’ ἀνεχώρησαν.

[7] But Ulysses found a club lying there, and with the help of four comrades he sharpened it, and, having heated it in the fire, he blinded him. And when Polyphemus cried to the Cyclopes round about for help, they came and asked who was hurting him, and when he said, “ Nobody,” they thought he meant that he was being hurt by nobody, and so they retired.

[8] ἐπιζητούντων δὲ τῶν ποιμνίων τὴν συνήθη νομήν, ἀνοίξας καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ προθύρου στὰς τὰς χεῖρας ἐκπετάσας ἐψηλάφα τὰ ποίμνια. Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ τρεῖς κριοὺς ὁμοῦ συνδέων ... καὶ αὐτὸς τῷ μείζονι ὑποδύς, ὑπὸ τὴν γαστέρα κρυβείς, σὺν τοῖς ποιμνίοις ἐξῆλθε, καὶ λύσας τοὺς ἑταίρους τῶν ποιμνίων, ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς ἐλάσας ἀποπλέων ἀνεβόησε Κύκλωπι ὡς Ὀδυσσεὺς εἴη καὶ ἐκπεφεύγοι τὰς ἐκείνου χεῖρας.

[8] And when the flocks sought their usual pasture, he opened the cave, and standing at the doorway spread out his hands and felt the sheep. But Ulysses tied three rams together, ... and himself getting under the bigger, and hiding under its belly, he passed out with the sheep. And having released his comrades from the sheep, he drove the animals to the ships, and sailing away shouted to the Cyclops that he was Ulysses and that he had escaped out of his hands.

[9] ἦν δὲ λόγιον Κύκλωπι εἰρημένον ὑπὸ μάντεως τυφλωθῆναι ὑπὸ Ὀδυσσέως. καὶ μαθὼν τὸ ὄνομα πέτρας ἀποσπῶν ἠκόντιζεν εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν, μόλις δὲ ἡ ναῦς σώζεται πρὸς τὰς πέτρας. ἐκ τούτου δὲ μηνίει Ποσειδῶν Ὀδυσσεῖ.

[9] Now the Cyclops had been forewarned by a soothsayer that he should be blinded by Ulysses; and when he learned the name, he tore away rocks and hurled them into the sea, and hardly did the ship evade the rocks. From that time Poseidon was wroth with Ulysses.

[10] ἀναχθεὶς δὲ συμπάσαις ναυσὶ παραγίνεται εἰς Αἰολίαν νῆσον, ἧς ὁ βασιλεὺς ἦν Αἴολος. οὗτος ἐπιμελητὴς ὑπὸ Διὸς τῶν ἀνέμων καθεστήκει καὶ παύειν καὶ προΐεσθαι. ὃς ξενίσας Ὀδυσσέα δίδωσιν αὐτῷ ἀσκὸν βόειον, ἐν ᾧ κατέδησε τοὺς ἀνέμους, ὑποδείξας οἷς δεῖ χρῆσθαι πλέοντα, τοῦτον ἐν τῷ σκάφει καταδήσας. ὁ δὲ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἐπιτηδείοις ἀνέμοις χρώμενος εὐπλοεῖ, καὶ πλησίον Ἰθάκης ὑπάρχων ἤδη τὸν ἀναφερόμενον ἐκ τῆς πόλεως καπνὸν ἰδὼν ἐκοιμήθη.

[10] Having put to sea with all his ships, he came to the island of Aeolia, of which the king was Aeolus. He was appointed by Zeus keeper of the winds, both to calm them and to send them forth. Having entertained Ulysses, he gave him an oxhide bag in which he had bound fast the winds, after showing what winds to use on the voyage and binding fast the bag in the vessel. And by using suitable winds Ulysses had a prosperous voyage; and when he was near Ithaca and already saw the smoke rising from the town, he fell asleep.

[11] οἱ δὲ ἑταῖροι νομίζοντες χρυσὸν ἐν τῷ ἀσκῷ κομίζειν αὐτόν, λύσαντες τοὺς ἀνέμους ἐξαφῆκαν, καὶ πάλιν εἰς τοὐπίσω παρεγένοντο ὑπὸ τῶν πνευμάτων ἁρπασθέντες. Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ ἀφικόμενος πρὸς Αἴολον ἠξίου πομπῆς τυχεῖν, ὁ δὲ αὐτὸν ἐκβάλλει τῆς νήσου λέγων ἀντιπρασσόντων τῶν θεῶν μὴ δύνασθαι σώζειν.

[11] But his comrades, thinking he carried gold in the bag, loosed it and let the winds go free, and being swept away by the blasts they were driven back again. And having come to Aeolus, Ulysses begged that he might be granted a fair wind; but Aeolus drove him from the island, saying that he could not save him when the gods opposed.

[12] πλέων οὖν κατῆρε πρὸς Λαιστρυγόνας, καὶ ... τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ναῦν καθώρμισεν ἐσχάτως. Λαιστρυγόνες δ᾽ ἦσαν ἀνδροφάγοι, καὶ αὐτῶν ἐβασίλευεν Ἀντιφάτης. μαθεῖν οὖν Ὀδυσσεὺς βουλόμενος τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἔπεμψέ τινας πευσομένους. τούτοις δὲ ἡ τοῦ βασιλέως θυγάτηρ συντυγχάνει καὶ αὐτοὺς ἄγει πρὸς τὸν πατέρα.

[12] So sailing on he came to the land of the Laestrygones, and ... his own ship he moored last. Now the Laestrygones were cannibals, and their king was Antiphates. Wishing, therefore, to learn about the inhabitants, Ulysses sent some men to inquire. But the king’s daughter met them and led them to her father.

[13] ὁ δὲ ἕνα μὲν αὐτῶν ἁρπάσας ἀναλίσκει, τοὺς δὲ λοιποὺς ἐδίωκε φεύγοντας κεκραγὼς καὶ συγκαλῶν τοὺς ἄλλους Λαιστρυγόνας. οἱ δὲ ἦλθον ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ βάλλοντες πέτροις τὰ μὲν σκάφη κατέαξαν, αὐτοὺς δὲ ἐβίβρωσκον. Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ κόψας τὸ πεῖσμα τῆς νεὼς ἀνήχθη, αἱ δὲ λοιπαὶ σὺν τοῖς πλέουσιν ἀπώλοντο.

[13] And he snatched up one of them and devoured him; but the rest fled, and he pursued them, shouting and calling together the rest of the Laestrygones. They came to the sea, and by throwing stones they broke the vessels and ate the men. Ulysses cut the cable of his ship and put to sea; but the rest of the ships perished with their crews.

[14] μίαν δὲ ἔχων ναῦν Αἰαίῃ νήσῳ προσίσχει. ταύτην κατῴκει Κίρκη, θυγάτηρ Ἡλίου καὶ Πέρσης, Αἰήτου δὲ ἀδελφή, πάντων ἔμπειρος οὖσα φαρμάκων. διελὼν τοὺς ἑταίρους αὐτὸς μὲν κλήρῳ μένει παρὰ τῇ νηί, Εὐρύλοχος δὲ πορεύεται μεθ᾽ ἑταίρων εἰκοσιδύο τὸν ἀριθμὸν πρὸς Κίρκην.

[14] With one ship he put in to the Aeaean isle. It was inhabited by Circe, a daughter of the Sun and of Perse, and a sister of Aeetes; skilled in all enchantments was she. Having divided his comrades, Ulysses himself abode by the ship, in accordance with the lot, but Eurylochus with two and twenty comrades repaired to Circe.

[15] καλούσης δὲ αὐτῆς χωρὶς Εὐρυλόχου πάντες εἰσίασιν. ἡ δ᾽ ἑκάστῳ κυκεῶνα πλήσασα τυροῦ καὶ μέλιτος καὶ ἀλφίτων καὶ οἴνου δίδωσι, μίξασα φαρμάκῳ. πιόντων δὲ αὐτῶν, ἐφαπτομένη ῥάβδῳ τὰς μορφὰς ἠλλοίου, καὶ τοὺς μὲν ἐποίει λύκους, τοὺς δὲ σῦς, τοὺς δὲ ὄνους, τοὺς δὲ λέοντας.

[15] At her call they all entered except Eurylochus; and to each she gave a tankard she had filled with cheese and honey and barley meal and wine, and mixed with an enchantment. And when they had drunk, she touched them with a wand and changed their shapes, and some she made wolves, and some swine, and some asses, and some lions.

[16] Εὐρύλοχος δὲ ἰδὼν ταῦτα Ὀδυσσεῖ ἀπαγγέλλει. ὁ δὲ λαβὼν μῶλυ παρὰ Ἑρμοῦ πρὸς Κίρκην ἔρχεται, καὶ βαλὼν εἰς τὰ φάρμακα τὸ μῶλυ μόνος πιὼν οὐ φαρμάσσεται: σπασάμενος δὲ τὸ ξίφος ἤθελε Κίρκην ἀποκτεῖναι. ἡ δὲ τὴν ὀργὴν παύσασα τοὺς ἑταίρους ἀποκαθίστησι. καὶ λαβὼν ὅρκους Ὀδυσσεὺς παρ᾽ αὐτῆς μηδὲν ἀδικηθῆναι συνευνάζεται, καὶ γίνεται αὐτῷ παῖς Τηλέγονος.

[16] But Eurylochus saw these things and reported them to Ulysses. And Ulysses went to Circe with moly, which he had received from Hermes, and throwing the moly among her enchantments, he drank and alone was not enchanted. Then drawing his sword, he would have killed her, but she appeased his wrath and restored his comrades. And when he had taken an oath of her that he should suffer no harm, Ulysses shared her bed, and a son, Telegonus, was born to him.

[17] ἐνιαυτὸν δὲ μείνας ἐκεῖ, πλεύσας τὸν Ὠκεανόν, σφάγια ταῖς ψυχαῖς ποιησάμενος μαντεύεται παρὰ Τειρεσίου, Κίρκης ὑποθεμένης, καὶ θεωρεῖ τάς τε τῶν ἡρώων ψυχὰς καὶ τῶν ἡρωΐδων. βλέπει δὲ καὶ τὴν μητέρα Ἀντίκλειαν καὶ Ἐλπήνορα, ὃς ἐν τοῖς Κίρκης πεσὼν ἐτελεύτησε.

[17] Having tarried a year there, he sailed the ocean, and offered sacrifices to the souls, and by Circe’s advice consulted the soothsayer Tiresias, and beheld the souls both of heroes and of heroines. He also looked on his mother Anticlia and Elpenor, who had died of a fall in the house of Circe.

[18] παραγενόμενος δὲ πρὸς Κίρκην ὑπ᾽ ἐκείνης προπεμφθεὶς ἀνήχθη, καὶ τὴν νῆσον παρέπλει τῶν Σειρήνων. αἱ δὲ Σειρῆνες ἦσαν Ἀχελῴου καὶ Μελπομένης μιᾶς τῶν Μουσῶν θυγατέρες, Πεισινόη Ἀγλαόπη Θελξιέπεια. τούτων ἡ μὲν ἐκιθάριζεν, ἡ δὲ ᾖδεν, ἡ δὲ ηὔλει, καὶ διὰ τούτων ἔπειθον καταμένειν τοὺς παραπλέοντας.

[18] And having come to Circe he was sent on his way by her, and put to sea, and sailed past the isle of the Sirens. Now the Sirens were Pisinoe, Aglaope, and Thelxiepia, daughters of Achelous and Melpomene, one of the Muses. One of them played the lyre, another sang, and another played the flute, and by these means they were fain to persuade passing mariners to linger;

[19] εἶχον δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν μηρῶν ὀρνίθων μορφάς. ταύτας παραπλέων Ὀδυσσεύς, τῆς ᾠδῆς βουλόμενος ὑπακοῦσαι, Κίρκης ὑποθεμένης τῶν μὲν ἑταίρων τὰ ὦτα ἔβυσε κηρῷ, ἑαυτὸν δὲ ἐκέλευσε προσδεθῆναι τῷ ἱστῷ. πειθόμενος δὲ ὑπὸ τῶν Σειρήνων καταμένειν ἠξίου λυθῆναι, οἱ δὲ μᾶλλον αὐτὸν ἐδέσμευον, καὶ οὕτω παρέπλει. ἦν δὲ αὐταῖς Σειρῆσι λόγιον τελευτῆσαι νεὼς παρελθούσης. αἱ μὲν οὖν ἐτελεύτων.

[19] and from the thighs they had the forms of birds. Sailing by them, Ulysses wished to hear their song, so by Circe’s advice he stopped the ears of his comrades with wax, and ordered that he should himself be bound to the mast. And being persuaded by the Sirens to linger, he begged to be released, but they bound him the more, and so he sailed past. Now it was predicted of the Sirens that they should themselves die when a ship should pass them; so die they did.

[20] μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο παραγίνεται ἐπὶ δισσὰς ὁδούς. ἔνθεν μὲν ἦσαν αἱ Πλαγκταὶ πέτραι, ἔνθεν δὲ ὑπερμεγέθεις σκόπελοι δύο. ἦν δὲ ἐν μὲν θατέρῳ Σκύλλα, Κραταιίδος θυγάτηρ καὶ † Τριήνου ἢ Φόρκου, πρόσωπον ἔχουσα καὶ στέρνα γυναικός, ἐκ λαγόνων δὲ κεφαλὰς ἓξ καὶ δώδεκα πόδας κυνῶν.

[20] And after that he came to two ways. On the one side were the Wandering Rocks, and on the other side two huge cliffs, and in one of them was Scylla, a daughter of Crataeis and Trienus or Phorcus, with the face and breast of a woman, but from the flanks she had six heads and twelve feet of dogs.

[21] ἐν δὲ θατέρῳ τῷ σκοπέλῳ ἦν Χάρυβδις, ἣ τῆς ἡμέρας τρὶς ἀνασπῶσα τὸ ὕδωρ πάλιν ἀνίει. ὑποθεμένης δὲ Κίρκης, τὸν μὲν παρὰ τὰς Πλαγκτὰς πλοῦν ἐφυλάξατο, παρὰ δὲ τὸν τῆς Σκύλλης σκόπελον πλέων ἐπὶ τῆς πρύμνης ἔστη καθωπλισμένος. ἐπιφανεῖσα δὲ ἡ Σκύλλα ἓξ ἑταίρους ἁρπάσασα τούτους κατεβίβρωσκεν.

[21] And in the other cliff was Charybdis, who thrice a day drew up the water and spouted it again. By the advice of Circe he shunned the passage by the Wandering Rocks, and in sailing past the cliff of Scylla he stood fully armed on the poop. But Scylla appeared, snatched six of his comrades, and gobbled them up.

[22] ἐκεῖθεν δὲ ἐλθὼν εἰς Θρινακίαν νῆσον οὖσαν Ἡλίου, ἔνθα βόες ἐβόσκοντο, καὶ ἀπλοίᾳ κατασχεθεὶς ἔμεινεν αὐτοῦ. τῶν δὲ ἑταίρων σφαξάντων ἐκ τῶν βοῶν καὶ θοινησαμένων, λειφθέντων τροφῆς, Ἥλιος ἐμήνυσε Διί. καὶ ἀναχθέντα κεραυνῷ ἔβαλε.

[22] And thence he came to Thrinacia, an island of the Sun, where kine were grazing, and being windbound, he tarried there. But when his comrades slaughtered some of the kine and banqueted on them, for lack of food, the Sun reported it to Zeus, and when Ulysses put out to sea, Zeus struck him with a thunderbolt.

[23] λυθείσης δὲ τῆς νεὼς Ὀδυσσεὺς τὸν ἱστὸν κατασχὼν παραγίνεται εἰς τὴν Χάρυβδιν. τῆς δὲ Χαρύβδεως καταπινούσης τὸν ἱστόν, ἐπιλαβόμενος ὑπερπεφυκότος ἐρινεοῦ περιέμεινε. καὶ πάλιν ἀνεθέντα τὸν ἱστὸν θεωρήσας, ἐπὶ τοῦτον ῥίψας εἰς Ὠγυγίαν νῆσον διεκομίσθη.

[23] And when the ship broke up, Ulysses clung to the mast and drifted to Charybdis. And when Charybdis sucked down the mast, he clutched an overhanging wild fig-tree and waited, and when he saw the mast shot up again, he cast himself on it, and was carried across to the island of Ogygia.

[24] ἐκεῖ δὲ ἀποδέχεται Καλυψὼ θυγάτηρ Ἄτλαντος, καὶ συνευνασθεῖσα γεννᾷ παῖδα Λατῖνον. μένει δὲ παρ᾽ αὐτῇ πενταετίαν, καὶ σχεδίαν ποιήσας ἀποπλεῖ. ταύτης δὲ ἐν τῷ πελάγει διαλυθείσης ὀργῇ Ποσειδῶνος, γυμνὸς πρὸς Φαίακας ἐκβράσσεται.

[24] There Calypso, daughter of Atlas, received him, and bedding with him bore a son Latinus. He stayed with her five years, and then made a raft and sailed away. But on the high sea the raft was broken in pieces by the wrath of Poseidon, and Ulysses was washed up naked on the shore of the Phaeacians.

[25] Ναυσικάα δέ, ἡ τοῦ βασιλέως θυγάτηρ Ἀλκινόου, πλύνουσα τὴν ἐσθῆτα ἱκετεύσαντα αὐτὸν ἄγει πρὸς Ἀλκίνοον, ὃς αὐτὸν ξενίζει καὶ δῶρα δοὺς μετὰ πομπῆς αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν πατρίδα ἐξέπεμψε. Ποσειδῶν δὲ Φαίαξι μηνίσας τὴν μὲν ναῦν ἀπελίθωσε, τὴν δὲ πόλιν ὄρει περικαλύπτει.

[25] Now Nausicaa, the daughter of king Alcinous, was washing the clothes, and when Ulysses implored her protection, she brought him to Alcinous, who entertained him, and after bestowing gifts on him sent him away with a convoy to his native land. But Poseidon was wroth with the Phaeacians, and he turned the ship to stone and enveloped the city with a mountain.

[26] Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ παραγενόμενος εἰς τὴν πατρίδα εὑρίσκει τὸν οἶκον διεφθαρμένον: νομίσαντες γὰρ αὐτὸν τεθνάναι Πηνελόπην ἐμνῶντο ἐκ Δουλιχίου μὲν νζ:

[26] And on arriving in his native land Ulysses found his substance wasted; for, believing that he was dead, suitors were wooing Penelope. From Dulichium came fifty-seven:

[27] Ἀμφίνομος Θόας Δημοπτόλεμος Ἀμφίμαχος Εὐρύαλος, Πάραλος Εὐηνορίδης Κλυτίος Ἀγήνωρ Εὐρύπυλος, Πυλαιμένης Ἀκάμας Θερσίλοχος Ἅγιος Κλύμενος, Φιλόδημος Μενεπτόλεμος Δαμάστωρ Βίας Τέλμιος, Πολύιδος Ἀστύλοχος Σχεδίος Ἀντίγονος Μάρψιος, Ἰφιδάμας Ἀργεῖος Γλαῦκος Καλυδωνεὺς Ἐχίων, Λάμας Ἀνδραίμων Ἀγέρωχος Μέδων Ἄγριος, Πρόμος Κτήσιος Ἀκαρνάν Κύκνος Ψηρᾶς, Ἑλλάνικος Περίφρων Μεγασθένης Θρασυμήδης Ὀρμένιος, Διοπίθης Μηκιστεὺς Ἀντίμαχος Πτολεμαῖος Λεστορίδης, Νικόμαχος Πολυποίτης Κεραός.

[27] Amphinomus, Thoas, Demoptolemus, Amphimachus, Euryalus, Paralus, Evenorides, Clytius, Agenor, Eurypylus, Pylaemenes, Acamas, Thersilochus, Hagius, Clymenus, Philodemus, Meneptolemus, Damastor, Bias, Telmius, Polyidus, Astylochus, Schedius, Antigonus, Marpsius, Iphidamas, Argius, Glaucus, Calydoneus, Echion, Lamas, Andraemon, Agerochus, Medon, Agrius, Promus, Ctesius, Acarnan, Cycnus, Pseras, Hellanicus, Periphron, Megasthenes, Thrasymedes, Ormenius, Diopithes, Mecisteus, Antimachus, Ptolemaeus, Lestorides, Nicomachus, Polypoetes, and Ceraus.

[28] ἐκ δὲ Σάμης κγ: Ἀγέλαος Πείσανδρος Ἔλατος Κτήσιππος Ἱππόδοχος, Εὐρύστρατος Ἀρχέμολος Ἴθακος Πεισήνωρ Ὑπερήνωρ, Φεροίτης Ἀντισθένης Κέρβερος Περιμήδης Κῦννος, Θρίασος Ἐτεωνεὺς Κλυτίος Πρόθοος Λύκαιθος, Εὔμηλος Ἴτανος Λύαμμος.

[28] And from Samethere came twenty — three: — Agelaus, Pisander, Elatus, Ctesippus, Hippodochus, Eurystratus, Archemolus, Ithacus, Pisenor, Hyperenor, Pheroetes, Antisthenes, Cerberus, Perimedes, Cynnus, Thriasus, Eteoneus, Clytius, Prothous, Lycaethus, Eumelus, Itanus, Lyammus.

[29] ἐκ δὲ Ζακύνθου μδ: Εὐρύλοχος Λαομήδης Μόλεβος Φρένιος Ἴνδιος, Μίνις Λειώκριτος Πρόνομος Νίσας Δαήμων, Ἀρχέστρατος Ἱππόμαχος Εὐρύαλος Περίαλλος Εὐηνορίδης, Κλυτίος Ἀγήνωρ Πόλυβος Πολύδωρος Θαδύτιος, Στράτιος Φρένιος Ἴνδιος Δαισήνωρ Λαομέδων, Λαόδικος Ἅλιος Μάγνης Ὀλοίτροχος Βάρθας, Θεόφρων Νισσαῖος Ἀλκάροψ Περικλύμενος Ἀντήνωρ, Πέλλας Κέλτος Περίφας Ὄρμενος Πόλυβος, Ἀνδρομήδης.

[29] And from Zacynthos came forty — four: Eurylochus, Laomedes, Molebus, Phrenius, Indius, Minis, Liocritus, Pronomus, Nisas, Daemon, Archestratus, Hippomachus, Euryalus, Periallus, Evenorides, Clytius, Agenor, Polybus, Polydorus, Thadytius, Stratius, Phrenius, Indius, Daesenor, Laomedon, Laodicus, Halius, Magnes, Oloetrochus, Barthas, Theophron, Nissaeus, Alcarops, Periclymenus, Antenor, Pellas, Celtus, Periphus, Ormenus, Polybus and Andromedes.

[30] ἐκ δὲ αὐτῆς Ἰθάκης ἦσαν οἱ μνηστευόμενοι ιβ οἵδε: Ἀντίνοος Πρόνοος Λειώδης Εὐρύνομος Ἀμφίμαχος, Ἀμφίαλος Πρόμαχος Ἀμφιμέδων Ἀρίστρατος Ἕλενος, Δουλιχιεὺς Κτήσιππος.

[30] And from Ithaca itself the suitors were twelve, to wit: — Antinous, Pronous, Liodes, Eurynomus, Amphimachus, Amphialus, Promachus, Amphimedon, Aristratus, Helenus, Dulicheus, and Ctesippus.

[31] οὗτοι πορευόμενοι εἰς τὰ βασίλεια δαπανῶντες τὰς Ὀδυσσέως ἀγέλας εὐωχοῦντο. Πηνελόπη δὲ ἀναγκαζομένη τὸν γάμον ὑπέσχετο ὅτε τὸ ἐντάφιον Λαέρτῃ πέρας ἕξει, καὶ τοῦτο ὕφηνεν ἐπὶ ἔτη τρία, μεθ᾽ ἡμέραν μὲν ὑφαίνουσα, νύκτωρ δὲ ἀναλύουσα. τοῦτον τὸν τρόπον ἐξηπατῶντο οἱ μνηστῆρες ὑπὸ τῆς Πηνελόπης, μέχρις ὅτε ἐφωράθη.

[31] These, journeying to the palace, consumed the herds of Ulysses at their feasts. And Penelope was compelled to promise that she would wed when the shroud of Laertes was finished, and she wove it for three years, weaving it by day and undoing it by night. In this way the suitors were deceived by Penelope, till she was detected.

[32] Ὀδυσσεὺς δὲ μαθὼν τὰ κατὰ τὴν οἰκίαν, ὡς ἐπαίτης πρὸς Εὔμαιον οἰκέτην ἀφικνεῖται, καὶ Τηλεμάχῳ ἀναγνωρίζεται, καὶ παραγίνεται εἰς τὴν πόλιν. Μελάνθιος δὲ αὐτοῖς συντυχὼν ὁ αἰπόλος οἰκέτης ὑπάρχων ἀτιμάζει. παραγενόμενος δὲ εἰς τὰ βασίλεια τοὺς μνηστῆρας μετῄτει τροφήν, καὶ εὑρὼν μεταίτην Ἶρον καλούμενον διαπαλαίει αὐτῷ. Εὐμαίῳ δὲ μηνύσας ἑαυτὸν καὶ Φιλοιτίῳ, μετὰ τούτων καὶ Τηλεμάχου τοῖς μνηστῆρσιν ἐπιβουλεύει.

[32] And Ulysses, being apprized of the state of things at home, came to his servant Eumaeus in the guise of a beggar, and made himself known to Telemachus, and arrived in the city. And Melanthius, the goatherd, a servant man, met them, and scorned them. On coming to the palace Ulysses begged food of the suitors, and finding a beggar called Irus he wrestled with him. But he revealed himself to Eumaeus and Philoetius, and along with them and Telemachus he laid a plot for the suitors.

[33] Πηνελόπη δὲ τοῖς μνηστῆρσι τίθησιν Ὀδυσσέως τόξον, ὃ παρὰ Ἰφίτου ποτὲ ἔλαβε, καὶ τῷ τοῦτο τείναντί φησι συνοικήσειν. μηδενὸς δὲ τεῖναι δυναμένου, δεξάμενος Ὀδυσσεὺς τοὺς μνηστῆρας κατετόξευσε σὺν Εὐμαίῳ καὶ Φιλοιτίῳ καὶ Τηλεμάχῳ. ἀνεῖλε δὲ καὶ Μελάνθιον καὶ τὰς συνευναζομένας τοῖς μνηστῆρσι θεραπαίνας, καὶ τῇ γυναικὶ καὶ τῷ πατρὶ ἀναγνωρίζεται.

[33] Now Penelope delivered to the suitors the bow of Ulysses, which he had once received from Iphitus; and she said that she would marry him who bent the bow. When none of them could bend it, Ulysses took it and shot down the suitors, with the help of Eumaeus, Philoetius, and Telemachus. He killed also Melanthius, and the handmaids that bedded with the suitors, and he made himself known to his wife and his father.

[34] θύσας δὲ Ἅιδῃ καὶ Περσεφόνῃ καὶ Τειρεσίᾳ, πεζῇ διὰ τῆς Ἠπείρου βαδίζων εἰς Θεσπρωτοὺς παραγίνεται καὶ κατὰ τὰς Τειρεσίου μαντείας θυσιάσας ἐξιλάσκεται Ποσειδῶνα. ἡ δὲ βασιλεύουσα τότε Θεσπρωτῶν Καλλιδίκη καταμένειν αὐτὸν ἠξίου τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτῷ δοῦσα.

[34] And after sacrificing to Hades, and Persephone, and Tiresias, he journeyed on foot through Epirus, and came to the Thesprotians, and having offered sacrifice according to the directions of the soothsayer Tiresias, he propitiated Poseidon. But Callidice, who was then queen of the Thesprotians, urged him to stay and offered him the kingdom;

[35] καὶ συνελθοῦσα αὐτῷ γεννᾷ Πολυποίτην. γήμας δὲ Καλλιδίκην Θεσπρωτῶν ἐβασίλευσε καὶ μάχῃ τῶν περιοίκων νικᾷ τοὺς ἐπιστρατεύσαντας. Καλλιδίκης δὲ ἀποθανούσης, τῷ παιδὶ τὴν βασιλείαν ἀποδιδοὺς εἰς Ἰθάκην παραγίνεται, καὶ εὑρίσκει ἐκ Πηνελόπης Πολιπόρθην αὐτῷ γεγεννημένον.

[35] and she had by him a son Polypoetes. And having married Callidice, he reigned over the Thesprotians, and defeated in battle the neighboring peoples who attacked him. But when Callidice died he handed over the kingdom to his son and repaired to Ithaca, and there he found Poliporthes, whom Penelope had borne to him.

[36] Τηλέγονος δὲ παρὰ Κίρκης μαθὼν ὅτι παῖς Ὀδυσσέως ἐστίν, ἐπὶ τὴν τούτου ζήτησιν ἐκπλεῖ. παραγενόμενος δὲ εἰς Ἰθάκην τὴν νῆσον ἀπελαύνει τινὰ τῶν βοσκημάτων, καὶ Ὀδυσσέα βοηθοῦντα τῷ μετὰ χεῖρας δόρατι Τηλέγονος τρυγόνος κέντρον τὴν αἰχμὴν ἔχοντι τιτρώσκει, καὶ Ὀδυσσεὺς θνήσκει.

[36] When Telegonus learned from Circe that he was a son of Ulysses, he sailed in search of him. And having come to the island of Ithaca, he drove away some of the cattle, and when Ulysses defended them, Telegonus wounded him with the spear he had in his hands, which was barbed with the spine of a sting-ray, and Ulysses died of the wound.

[37] ἀναγνωρισάμενος δὲ αὐτὸν καὶ πολλὰ κατοδυράμενος, τὸν νεκρὸν καὶ τὴν Πηνελόπην πρὸς Κίρκην ἄγει, κἀκεῖ τὴν Πηνελόπην γαμεῖ. Κίρκη δὲ ἑκατέρους αὐτοὺς εἰς Μακάρων νήσους ἀποστέλλει.

[37] But when Telegonus recognized him, he bitterly lamented, and conveyed the corpse and Penelope to Circe, and there he married Penelope. And Circe sent them both away to the Islands of the Blest.

[38] τινὲς δὲ Πηνελόπην ὑπὸ Ἀντινόου φθαρεῖσαν λέγουσιν ὑπὸ Ὀδυσσέως πρὸς τὸν πατέρα Ἰκάριον ἀποσταλῆναι, γενομένην δὲ τῆς Ἀρκαδίας κατὰ Μαντίνειαν ἐξ Ἑρμοῦ τεκεῖν Πᾶνα:

[38] But some say that Penelope was seduced by Antinous and sent away by Ulysses to her father Icarius, and that when she came to Mantinea in Arcadia she bore Pan to Hermes.

[39] ἄλλοι δὲ δι᾽ Ἀμφίνομον ὑπὸ Ὀδυσσέως αὐτοῦ τελευτῆσαι: διαφθαρῆναι γὰρ αὐτὴν ὑπὸ τούτου λέγουσιν.

[39] However others say that she met her end at the hands of Ulysses himself on account of Amphinomus, for they allege that she was seduced by him.

[40] εἰσὶ δὲ οἱ λέγοντες ἐγκαλούμενον Ὀδυσσέα ὑπὸ τῶν οἰκείων ὑπὲρ τῶν ἀπολωλότων δικαστὴν Νεοπτόλεμον λαβεῖν τὸν βασιλεύοντα τῶν κατὰ τὴν Ἤπειρον νήσων, τοῦτον δέ, νομίσαντα ἐκποδὼν Ὀδυσσέως γενομένου Κεφαλληνίαν καθέξειν, κατακρῖναι φυγὴν αὐτοῦ, Ὀδυσσέα δὲ εἰς Αἰτωλίαν πρὸς Θόαντα τὸν Ἀνδραίμονος παραγενόμενον τὴν τούτου θυγατέρα γῆμαι, καὶ καταλιπόντα παῖδα Λεοντοφόνον ἐκ ταύτης γηραιὸν τελευτῆσαι.

[40] And there are some who say that Ulysses, being accused by the kinsfolk of the slain, submitted the case to the judgment of Neoptolemus, king of the islands off Epirus; that Neoptolemus, thinking to get possession of Cephallenia if once Ulysses were put out of the way, condemned him to exile; and that Ulysses went to Aetolia, to Thoas, son of Andraemon, married the daughter of Thoas, and leaving a son Leontophonus, whom he had by her, died in old age.
